Our findings align with other surveys and studies—in fact, <a href=\"https://www.wipo.int/pressroom/en/articles/2019/article_0001.html\">a recent study by the World Intellectual Patent Office (WIPO)</a> found that the surge in research in AI and machine learning (ML) has been accompanied by an even stronger growth in AI-related patent applications.

Image source: Ben Lorica.</figcaption></figure>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/data/free/ai-adoption-in-the-enterprise.csp\">When we asked</a> what held back their adoption of AI technologies, respondents cited a few reasons, including some that pertained to culture, organization, and skills:</p>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n<li>[23%] Company culture does not yet recognize needs for AI</li>\\r\\n\\r\\n<li>[18%] Lack of skilled people / difficulting hiring the required roles</li>\\r\\n\\r\\n<li>[17%] Difficulties in identifying appropriate business use cases</li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Implementing and incorporating AI and machine learning technologies will require retraining across an organization, not just technical teams. Recall that the rise of big data and data science necessitated a certain amount of retraining across an entire organization: technologists and analysts needed to familiarize themselves with new tools and architectures, but business experts and managers also needed to reorient their workflows to adjust to data-driven processes and data-intensive systems. AI and machine learning will require a similar holistic approach to training. Here are a few reasons why:</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n\\t<li>As noted from our survey, identifying appropriate business use cases remains an ongoing challenge. Domain experts and business owners need to develop an understanding of these technologies in order to be able to highlight areas where they are likely to make an impact within a company.</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Members of an organization will need to understand—even at a high-level—the current state of AI and ML technologies so they know the strengths and limitations of these new tools. For instance, in the case of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robotic_process_automation\">robotic process automation (RPA)</a>, it’s really the people closest to tasks (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/timoreilly/status/1111421767216562176\">“bottoms up”</a>) who can best identify areas where it is most suitable.</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>AI and machine learning depend on data (usually labeled training data for machine learning models), and in many instances, a certain amount of domain knowledge will be needed to assemble high-quality data.</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Machine learning and AI involve end-to-end pipelines, so development/testing/integration will often cut across technical roles and technical teams.</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>AI and machine learning applications and solutions often interact with (or augment) users and domain experts, so UX/design remains critical.</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>\\r\\n<a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/how-machine-learning-impacts-information-security\">Security</a>, privacy, <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/why-its-hard-to-design-fair-machine-learning-models\">ethics</a>, and other <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/managing-risk-in-machine-learning\">risk and compliance issues</a> will increasingly require that companies set up <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/managing-risk-in-machine-learning-models\">cross-functional teams</a> when they build AI and machine learning systems and products.</li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>At our upcoming <a href=\"http://theaiconf.com\">Artificial Intelligence conferences</a> in <a href=\"https://conferences.oreilly.com/artificial-intelligence/ai-ca\">San Jose</a> and <a href=\"https://conferences.oreilly.com/artificial-intelligence/ai-eu\">London</a>, we have assembled a roster of two-day training sessions, tutorials, and presentations to help individuals (across job roles and functions) sharpen their skills and understanding of AI and machine learning. We return to San Jose with a two-day <a href=\"https://conferences.oreilly.com/artificial-intelligence/ai-ca/public/schedule/topic/3035\">Business Summit</a> designed specifically for executives, business leaders, and strategists. This Business Summit includes a popular two-day training—<a href=\"https://conferences.oreilly.com/artificial-intelligence/ai-ca/public/schedule/detail/76708\">AI for Managers</a>—and tutorials—<a href=\"https://conferences.oreilly.com/artificial-intelligence/ai-ca/public/schedule/detail/77146\">Bringing AI into the enterprise</a> and <a href=\"https://conferences.oreilly.com/artificial-intelligence/ai-ca/public/schedule/detail/76831\">Design Thinking for AI</a>—along with 12 executive briefings designed to provide in-depth overviews into important topics in AI. We are also debuting a new half-day tutorial that will be taught by Ira Cohen (<a href=\"https://conferences.oreilly.com/artificial-intelligence/ai-ca/public/schedule/detail/77039\">Product management in the Machine Learning era</a>), which given the growing importance of AI and ML, is one that <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6541742478540840960\">every manager</a> should consider attending.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>We will also have our usual strong slate of technical training, tutorials, and talks. Here are some two-day training sessions and tutorials that I am excited about:</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n\\t<li>\\r\\n<a href=\"https://conferences.oreilly.com/artificial-intelligence/ai-ca/public/schedule/stype/1396\">Two-day training sessions</a> on TensorFlow, PyTorch, NLP with deep learning, and MLflow</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Given the recent research progress in natural language models, companies are eager to learn how to put these <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/lessons-learned-building-natural-language-processing-systems-in-health-care\">research results to work into their domains</a>. We are happy to announce two new half-day tutorials that will be taught by Lukas Biewald (<a href=\"https://conferences.oreilly.com/artificial-intelligence/ai-ca/public/schedule/detail/77731\">“Using Keras to classify text with LSTMs and other ML techniques”</a>) and Joel Grus (<a href=\"https://conferences.oreilly.com/artificial-intelligence/ai-ca/public/schedule/detail/78397\">“Putting cutting-edge modern NLP into practice”</a>).</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Deep learning remains a new topic for many companies, and organizations are interested in augmenting or replacing their existing ML systems with this class of techniques. Neil Conway and Yoav Zimmerman are teaching an important new half-day tutorial—<a href=\"https://conferences.oreilly.com/artificial-intelligence/ai-ca/public/schedule/detail/77041\">Modern Deep Learning: Tools and Techniques</a>—designed to provide concrete takeaways and best practices for developers, researchers, ML engineers, and technical managers. If your organization is serious about using deep learning, this is a tutorial that you and your colleagues should consider attending.</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Reinforcement learning (RL) remains a popular topic at our AI conference. We have a new tutorial—<a href=\"https://conferences.oreilly.com/artificial-intelligence/ai-ca/public/schedule/detail/78681\">ML problem-solving with a game engine</a>—that will help participants get started using RL with the Unity engine. A team from <a href=\"https://rise.cs.berkeley.edu/\">RISE Lab</a> will teach <a href=\"https://conferences.oreilly.com/artificial-intelligence/ai-ca/public/schedule/detail/77026\">an updated tutorial on Ray</a>, an open source distributed computing framework that includes a popular library for RL (<a href=\"https://ray.readthedocs.io/en/latest/rllib.html\">RLlib</a>). As I noted in a <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/ai-adoption-is-being-fueled-by-an-improved-tool-ecosystem\">recent post</a>, Ray continues to <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/the-evolution-and-expanding-utility-of-ray\">grow impressively along multiple fronts</a>, including number of users, contributors, and libraries.</li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>AI and ML are going to impact and permeate most aspects of a company’s operations, products, and services. To succeed in implementing and incorporating AI and machine learning technologies, companies need to take a more holistic approach toward retraining their workforces. This will be an ongoing endeavor as research results continue to be translated into practical systems that companies can use. Individuals will need to continue to learn new skills as technologies continue to evolve and because many areas of AI and ML are increasingly becoming democratized.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><strong>Related training and tutorial links:</strong></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n\\t<li><a href=\"https://conferences.oreilly.com/artificial-intelligence/ai-ca/public/schedule/detail/77039\">Product management in the Machine Learning era</a></li>\\r\\n\\t<li><a href=\"https://conferences.oreilly.com/artificial-intelligence/ai-ca/public/schedule/detail/76708\">AI for Managers</a></li>\\r\\n\\t<li><a href=\"https://conferences.oreilly.com/artificial-intelligence/ai-ca/public/schedule/detail/77041\">Modern Deep Learning: Tools and Techniques</a></li>\\r\\n\\t<li><a href=\"https://conferences.oreilly.com/artificial-intelligence/ai-ca/public/schedule/detail/77731\">Using Keras to classify text with LSTMs and other ML techniques</a></li>\\r\\n\\t<li><a href=\"https://conferences.oreilly.com/artificial-intelligence/ai-ca/public/schedule/detail/78397\">Putting cutting-edge modern NLP into practice</a></li>\\r\\n\\t<li><a href=\"https://conferences.oreilly.com/artificial-intelligence/ai-ca/public/schedule/detail/78681\">ML problem-solving with a game engine</a></li>\\r\\n\\t<li><a href=\"https://conferences.oreilly.com/artificial-intelligence/ai-ca/public/schedule/detail/77026\">Building reinforcement learning models and AI applications with Ray</a></li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n<p>Continue reading <a href=\\'https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/ai-and-machine-learning-will-require-retraining-your-entire-organization\\'>AI and machine learning will require retraining your entire organization.</a></p><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/oreilly/radar/atom/~4/O8-CdD6Trpo\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>'}],\n",

Recall that the rise of big data and data science necessitated a certain amount of retraining across an entire organization: technologists and analysts needed to familiarize themselves with new tools and architectures, but business experts and managers also needed to reorient their workflows to adjust to data-driven processes and data-intensive systems. AI and machine learning will require a similar holistic approach to training. Here are a few reasons why:</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n\\t<li>As noted from our survey, identifying appropriate business use cases remains an ongoing challenge. Domain experts and business owners need to develop an understanding of these technologies in order to be able to highlight areas where they are likely to make an impact within a company.</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Members of an organization will need to understand—even at a high-level—the current state of AI and ML technologies so they know the strengths and limitations of these new tools. For instance, in the case of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robotic_process_automation\">robotic process automation (RPA)</a>, it’s really the people closest to tasks (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/timoreilly/status/1111421767216562176\">“bottoms up”</a>) who can best identify areas where it is most suitable.</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>AI and machine learning depend on data (usually labeled training data for machine learning models), and in many instances, a certain amount of domain knowledge will be needed to assemble high-quality data.</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Machine learning and AI involve end-to-end pipelines, so development/testing/integration will often cut across technical roles and technical teams.</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>AI and machine learning applications and solutions often interact with (or augment) users and domain experts, so UX/design remains critical.</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>\\r\\n<a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/how-machine-learning-impacts-information-security\">Security</a>, privacy, <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/why-its-hard-to-design-fair-machine-learning-models\">ethics</a>, and other <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/managing-risk-in-machine-learning\">risk and compliance issues</a> will increasingly require that companies set up <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/managing-risk-in-machine-learning-models\">cross-functional teams</a> when they build AI and machine learning systems and products.</li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>At our upcoming <a href=\"http://theaiconf.com\">Artificial Intelligence conferences</a> in <a href=\"https://conferences.oreilly.com/artificial-intelligence/ai-ca\">San Jose</a> and <a href=\"https://conferences.oreilly.com/artificial-intelligence/ai-eu\">London</a>, we have assembled a roster of two-day training sessions, tutorials, and presentations to help individuals (across job roles and functions) sharpen their skills and understanding of AI and machine learning. We return to San Jose with a two-day <a href=\"https://conferences.oreilly.com/artificial-intelligence/ai-ca/public/schedule/topic/3035\">Business Summit</a> designed specifically for executives, business leaders, and strategists. This Business Summit includes a popular two-day training—<a href=\"https://conferences.oreilly.com/artificial-intelligence/ai-ca/public/schedule/detail/76708\">AI for Managers</a>—and tutorials—<a href=\"https://conferences.oreilly.com/artificial-intelligence/ai-ca/public/schedule/detail/77146\">Bringing AI into the enterprise</a> and <a href=\"https://conferences.oreilly.com/artificial-intelligence/ai-ca/public/schedule/detail/76831\">Design Thinking for AI</a>—along with 12 executive briefings designed to provide in-depth overviews into important topics in AI. We are also debuting a new half-day tutorial that will be taught by Ira Cohen (<a href=\"https://conferences.oreilly.com/artificial-intelligence/ai-ca/public/schedule/detail/77039\">Product management in the Machine Learning era</a>), which given the growing importance of AI and ML, is one that <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6541742478540840960\">every manager</a> should consider attending.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>We will also have our usual strong slate of technical training, tutorials, and talks. Here are some two-day training sessions and tutorials that I am excited about:</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n\\t<li>\\r\\n<a href=\"https://conferences.oreilly.com/artificial-intelligence/ai-ca/public/schedule/stype/1396\">Two-day training sessions</a> on TensorFlow, PyTorch, NLP with deep learning, and MLflow</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Given the recent research progress in natural language models, companies are eager to learn how to put these <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/lessons-learned-building-natural-language-processing-systems-in-health-care\">research results to work into their domains</a>. We are happy to announce two new half-day tutorials that will be taught by Lukas Biewald (<a href=\"https://conferences.oreilly.com/artificial-intelligence/ai-ca/public/schedule/detail/77731\">“Using Keras to classify text with LSTMs and other ML techniques”</a>) and Joel Grus (<a href=\"https://conferences.oreilly.com/artificial-intelligence/ai-ca/public/schedule/detail/78397\">“Putting cutting-edge modern NLP into practice”</a>).</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Deep learning remains a new topic for many companies, and organizations are interested in augmenting or replacing their existing ML systems with this class of techniques. Neil Conway and Yoav Zimmerman are teaching an important new half-day tutorial—<a href=\"https://conferences.oreilly.com/artificial-intelligence/ai-ca/public/schedule/detail/77041\">Modern Deep Learning: Tools and Techniques</a>—designed to provide concrete takeaways and best practices for developers, researchers, ML engineers, and technical managers. If your organization is serious about using deep learning, this is a tutorial that you and your colleagues should consider attending.</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Reinforcement learning (RL) remains a popular topic at our AI conference. We have a new tutorial—<a href=\"https://conferences.oreilly.com/artificial-intelligence/ai-ca/public/schedule/detail/78681\">ML problem-solving with a game engine</a>—that will help participants get started using RL with the Unity engine. A team from <a href=\"https://rise.cs.berkeley.edu/\">RISE Lab</a> will teach <a href=\"https://conferences.oreilly.com/artificial-intelligence/ai-ca/public/schedule/detail/77026\">an updated tutorial on Ray</a>, an open source distributed computing framework that includes a popular library for RL (<a href=\"https://ray.readthedocs.io/en/latest/rllib.html\">RLlib</a>). As I noted in a <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/ai-adoption-is-being-fueled-by-an-improved-tool-ecosystem\">recent post</a>, Ray continues to <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/the-evolution-and-expanding-utility-of-ray\">grow impressively along multiple fronts</a>, including number of users, contributors, and libraries.</li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>AI and ML are going to impact and permeate most aspects of a company’s operations, products, and services. To succeed in implementing and incorporating AI and machine learning technologies, companies need to take a more holistic approach toward retraining their workforces. This will be an ongoing endeavor as research results continue to be translated into practical systems that companies can use. Individuals will need to continue to learn new skills as technologies continue to evolve and because many areas of AI and ML are increasingly becoming democratized.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><strong>Related training and tutorial links:</strong></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n\\t<li><a href=\"https://conferences.oreilly.com/artificial-intelligence/ai-ca/public/schedule/detail/77039\">Product management in the Machine Learning era</a></li>\\r\\n\\t<li><a href=\"https://conferences.oreilly.com/artificial-intelligence/ai-ca/public/schedule/detail/76708\">AI for Managers</a></li>\\r\\n\\t<li><a href=\"https://conferences.oreilly.com/artificial-intelligence/ai-ca/public/schedule/detail/77041\">Modern Deep Learning: Tools and Techniques</a></li>\\r\\n\\t<li><a href=\"https://conferences.oreilly.com/artificial-intelligence/ai-ca/public/schedule/detail/77731\">Using Keras to classify text with LSTMs and other ML techniques</a></li>\\r\\n\\t<li><a href=\"https://conferences.oreilly.com/artificial-intelligence/ai-ca/public/schedule/detail/78397\">Putting cutting-edge modern NLP into practice</a></li>\\r\\n\\t<li><a href=\"https://conferences.oreilly.com/artificial-intelligence/ai-ca/public/schedule/detail/78681\">ML problem-solving with a game engine</a></li>\\r\\n\\t<li><a href=\"https://conferences.oreilly.com/artificial-intelligence/ai-ca/public/schedule/detail/77026\">Building reinforcement learning models and AI applications with Ray</a></li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n<p>Continue reading <a href=\\'https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/ai-and-machine-learning-will-require-retraining-your-entire-organization\\'>AI and machine learning will require retraining your entire organization.</a></p><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/oreilly/radar/atom/~4/O8-CdD6Trpo\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>',\n",

A few factors are contributing to this strong interest in implementing ML in products and services. First, the machine learning community has conducted groundbreaking research in many areas of interest to companies, and much of this research has been conducted out in the open via preprints and conference presentations.

In general, there are two main lines of work toward that goal: (1) clean the data you have, and (2) generate more data to help train needed models. Both directions have seen new advances in using ML models effectively, building on multiple new results from academia.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h2>Data integration and cleaning</h2>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>One of the biggest pitfalls in dealing with data quality is to treat all data problems the same. <a href=\"http://wp.sigmod.org/?p=2288\">Academic research</a> has been more deliberate in describing the different classes of data quality problems. We see two main classes of problems, which have varying degrees of complexity, and often mandate different approaches and tools to solve them. Since they consume <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/gilpress/2016/03/23/data-preparation-most-time-consuming-least-enjoyable-data-science-task-survey-says/#67adc2386f63\">a significant amount of time spent</a> on most data science projects, we highlight these two main classes of data quality problems in this post:</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n\\t<li>Data unification and integration</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Error detection and automatic repairing/imputation</li>\\r\\n</ol>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<h3>Data unification and integration</h3>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Even with the rise of open source tools for large-scale ingestion, messaging, queuing, and stream processing, siloed data and data sets trapped behind the bars of various business units is the normal state of affairs in any large enterprise. Data unification or integration refers to the set of activities that bring this data together into one unified data context. Schema matching and mapping, record linkage and deduplication, and various mastering activities are the types of tasks a data integration solution performs. Advances in ML offer a scalable and efficient way to replace legacy top-down, rule-based systems, which often result in massive costs and very low success in today’s big data settings. Bottom-up solutions with human-guided ML pipelines (such as Tamr, Paxata, or Informatica—<em>full disclosure: Ihab Ilyas is co-founder of Tamr</em>) show how to leverage the available rules and human expertise to train scalable integration models that work on thousands of sources and large volumes of data. We discussed some of the challenges and enablers in using ML for this class of problems in an earlier <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/three-enablers-for-machine-learning-in-data-unification-trust-legacy-and-scale\">post</a>.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The class of data unification problems has its own characteristics in terms of solution complexity: (1) the problem is often quadratic in the size of the input (since we need to compare everything to everything else), and (2) the main ML task is fairly understood and is mainly determining if two “things” are the same. These characteristics have a considerable impact on the design of the solution. For example, a complex sophisticated model for finding duplicates or matching schema is the least of our worries if we cannot even enumerate all possible pairs that need to be checked. Effective solutions for data unification problems tend to be a serious engineering effort to: (1) prune the space of possible candidates; (2) interact effectively with experts to provide training data and validate the machine decision; and (3) keep rich lineage and provenance to track decisions back for auditing, revising, or reusing for future use cases. Due to the nature of the ML task (mainly Boolean classification here), and the richness of structure, most successful models tend to be the good old “shallow” models, such as random forest, with the help of simple language models (to help with strings data). See this article on <a href=\"https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~ilyas/papers/StonebrakerIEEE2018.pdf\">data integration status</a> for details.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h3>Error detection, repairing and value imputation</h3>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Siloed or integrated data is often noisy, missing, and sometimes even has contradicting facts. <em>Data cleaning</em> is the class of data quality efforts that focuses on spotting and (hopefully) repairing such errors. Like data integration, data cleaning exercises often have been carried out with intensive labor work, or ad-hoc rule-based point solutions. However, this class has different complexities and characteristics that affect the design of the solution: the core ML task is often far more complex than a matching task, and requires building models that understand “how data was generated” and “how errors were introduced” to be able to reverse that process to spot and repair errors.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>While data cleaning has long been a research topic in academia, it often has been looked at as a theoretical logic problem. This probably explains why none of the solutions have been adopted in industry. The good news is that researchers from academia recently managed to leverage that large body of work and combine it with the power of scalable statistical inference for data cleaning. The open source <a href=\"http://www.holoclean.io\">HoloClean</a> probabilistic cleaning framework is currently the <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.03402\">state-of-the-art system</a> for ML-based automatic error detection and repair. HoloClean adopts the well-known <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noisy_channel_model\">“noisy channel”</a> model to explain how data was generated and how it was “polluted.” It then leverages all known domain knowledge (such as available rules), statistical information in the data, and available trusted sources to build complex data generation and error models. The models are then used to spot errors and suggest the “most probable” values to replace.</p> \\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Paying attention to scale is a requirement cleaning and integration have in common: building such complex models involves “featurizing” the whole data set via a series of operations—for example, to compute violations of rules, count co-occurrences, or build language models. Hence, an ML cleaning solution would need to be innovative on how to avoid the complexity of these operations. HoloClean, for example uses techniques to prune the domain of database cell and apply judicious relaxations to the underlying model to achieve the required scalability. Older research tools struggled with how to handle the various types of errors, and how to combine the heterogeneous quality input (e.g., business and quality rules, policies, statistical signals in the data, etc.). The HoloClean framework advances the state of the art in two fundamental ways: (1) combining the logical rules and the statistical distribution of the data into one coherent probabilistic model; and (2) scaling the learning and inference process via a series of system and model optimizations, which allowed it to be deployed in census organizations and large commercial enterprises.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<h2>Data programming</h2>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Increasing the quality of the available data via either unification or cleaning, or both, is definitely an important and a promising way forward to leverage enterprise data assets. However, the quest for <em>more</em> data is not over, for two main reasons:</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n\\t<li>ML models for cleaning and unification often need training data and examples of possible errors or matching records. Depending completely on human labeling for these examples is simply a non-starter; as ML models get more complex and the underlying data sources get larger, the need for more data increases, the scale of which cannot be achieved by human experts.</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Even if we boosted the quality of the available data via unification and cleaning, it still might not be enough to power the even more complex analytics and predictions models (often built as a deep learning model).</li>\\r\\n</ol>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>An important paradigm for solving both these problems is the concept of <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.07723\">data programming</a>. In a nutshell, data programming techniques provide ways to “manufacture” data that we can feed to various learning and predictions tasks (even for ML data quality solutions). In practical terms, “data programming” unifies a class of techniques used for the programmatic creation of training data sets. In this category of tools, frameworks like <a href=\"https://hazyresearch.github.io/snorkel/\">Snorkel</a> show how to allow developers and data scientists to focus on writing labeling functions to programmatically label data, and then model the noise in the labels to effectively train high-quality models. While using data programming to train high-quality analytics models might be clear, we find it interesting how it is used internally in ML models for the data unification and cleaning we mentioned earlier in this post. For example, tools like <a href=\"http://www.tamr.com\">Tamr</a> leverage legacy rules written by customers to generate a large amount of (programmatically) labeled data to power its matching ML pipeline. In a <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.02285\">recent paper,</a> the HoloClean project showed how to use “data augmentation” to generate many examples of possible errors (from a small seed) to power its automatic error detection model.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h2>Market validation</h2>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The landscape of solutions we presented here for the quest for high-quality data have already been well validated in the market today.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n\\t<li>ML solutions for data unification such as Tamr and Informatica have been deployed at a large number of Fortune-1000 enterprises.</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Automatic data cleaning solutions such as HoloClean already have been deployed by multiple financial services and the census bureaus of various countries.</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>As the growing <a href=\"https://hazyresearch.github.io/snorkel/\">list of Snorkel users</a> suggests, data programming solutions are beginning to change the way data scientists provision ML models.</li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>As we get more mature in understanding the differences between the various problems of integration, cleaning, and automatic data generation, we will see real improvement in handling the valuable data assets in the enterprise.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Machine learning applications rely on three main components: models, data, and compute. A lot of articles are written about new breakthrough models, many of which are created by researchers who publish not only papers, but code written in popular open source libraries. In addition, recent advances in automated machine learning has resulted in many tools that can (partially) automate model selection and hyperparameter tuning. Thus, many cutting-edge models are now available to data scientists. Similarly, cloud platforms have made compute and hardware more accessible to developers.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Models are increasingly becoming commodities. As we noted in the survey results above, the reality is that a lack of high-quality training data remains the main bottleneck in most machine learning projects. We believe that machine learning engineers and data scientists will continue to spend most of their time creating and refining training data. Fortunately, help is on the way: as we’ve described in this post, we are finally beginning to see a class of technologies aimed squarely at the need for quality training data.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><strong>Related content</strong>:</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n\\t<li><a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/three-enablers-for-machine-learning-in-data-unification-trust-legacy-and-scale\">“Three enablers for machine learning in data unification: Trust, legacy, and scale”</a></li>\\r\\n\\t<li><a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/software-2-and-snorkel\">“Software 2.0 and Snorkel”</a></li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Ihab Ilyas on <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/why-data-preparation-frameworks-rely-on-human-in-the-loop-systems\">“Why data preparation frameworks rely on human-in-the-loop systems”</a>\\r\\n</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Alex Ratner on <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/creating-large-training-data-sets-quickly\">“Creating large training data sets quickly”</a>\\r\\n</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Jeff Jonas on <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/real-time-entity-resolution-made-accessible\">“Real-time entity resolution made accessible”</a>\\r\\n</li>\\r\\n\\t<li><a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/data-collection-and-data-markets-in-the-age-of-privacy-and-machine-learning\">“Data collection and data markets in the age of privacy and machine learning”</a></li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Continue reading <a href=\\'https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/the-quest-for-high-quality-data\\'>The quest for high-quality data.</a></p><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/oreilly/radar/atom/~4/geym9vzewXA\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>'}],\n",

Both directions have seen new advances in using ML models effectively, building on multiple new results from academia.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h2>Data integration and cleaning</h2>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>One of the biggest pitfalls in dealing with data quality is to treat all data problems the same. <a href=\"http://wp.sigmod.org/?p=2288\">Academic research</a> has been more deliberate in describing the different classes of data quality problems. We see two main classes of problems, which have varying degrees of complexity, and often mandate different approaches and tools to solve them. Since they consume <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/gilpress/2016/03/23/data-preparation-most-time-consuming-least-enjoyable-data-science-task-survey-says/#67adc2386f63\">a significant amount of time spent</a> on most data science projects, we highlight these two main classes of data quality problems in this post:</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n\\t<li>Data unification and integration</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Error detection and automatic repairing/imputation</li>\\r\\n</ol>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<h3>Data unification and integration</h3>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Even with the rise of open source tools for large-scale ingestion, messaging, queuing, and stream processing, siloed data and data sets trapped behind the bars of various business units is the normal state of affairs in any large enterprise. Data unification or integration refers to the set of activities that bring this data together into one unified data context. Schema matching and mapping, record linkage and deduplication, and various mastering activities are the types of tasks a data integration solution performs. Advances in ML offer a scalable and efficient way to replace legacy top-down, rule-based systems, which often result in massive costs and very low success in today’s big data settings. Bottom-up solutions with human-guided ML pipelines (such as Tamr, Paxata, or Informatica—<em>full disclosure: Ihab Ilyas is co-founder of Tamr</em>) show how to leverage the available rules and human expertise to train scalable integration models that work on thousands of sources and large volumes of data. We discussed some of the challenges and enablers in using ML for this class of problems in an earlier <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/three-enablers-for-machine-learning-in-data-unification-trust-legacy-and-scale\">post</a>.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The class of data unification problems has its own characteristics in terms of solution complexity: (1) the problem is often quadratic in the size of the input (since we need to compare everything to everything else), and (2) the main ML task is fairly understood and is mainly determining if two “things” are the same. These characteristics have a considerable impact on the design of the solution. For example, a complex sophisticated model for finding duplicates or matching schema is the least of our worries if we cannot even enumerate all possible pairs that need to be checked. Effective solutions for data unification problems tend to be a serious engineering effort to: (1) prune the space of possible candidates; (2) interact effectively with experts to provide training data and validate the machine decision; and (3) keep rich lineage and provenance to track decisions back for auditing, revising, or reusing for future use cases. Due to the nature of the ML task (mainly Boolean classification here), and the richness of structure, most successful models tend to be the good old “shallow” models, such as random forest, with the help of simple language models (to help with strings data). See this article on <a href=\"https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~ilyas/papers/StonebrakerIEEE2018.pdf\">data integration status</a> for details.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h3>Error detection, repairing and value imputation</h3>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Siloed or integrated data is often noisy, missing, and sometimes even has contradicting facts. <em>Data cleaning</em> is the class of data quality efforts that focuses on spotting and (hopefully) repairing such errors. Like data integration, data cleaning exercises often have been carried out with intensive labor work, or ad-hoc rule-based point solutions. However, this class has different complexities and characteristics that affect the design of the solution: the core ML task is often far more complex than a matching task, and requires building models that understand “how data was generated” and “how errors were introduced” to be able to reverse that process to spot and repair errors.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>While data cleaning has long been a research topic in academia, it often has been looked at as a theoretical logic problem. This probably explains why none of the solutions have been adopted in industry. The good news is that researchers from academia recently managed to leverage that large body of work and combine it with the power of scalable statistical inference for data cleaning. The open source <a href=\"http://www.holoclean.io\">HoloClean</a> probabilistic cleaning framework is currently the <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.03402\">state-of-the-art system</a> for ML-based automatic error detection and repair. HoloClean adopts the well-known <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noisy_channel_model\">“noisy channel”</a> model to explain how data was generated and how it was “polluted.” It then leverages all known domain knowledge (such as available rules), statistical information in the data, and available trusted sources to build complex data generation and error models. The models are then used to spot errors and suggest the “most probable” values to replace.</p> \\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Paying attention to scale is a requirement cleaning and integration have in common: building such complex models involves “featurizing” the whole data set via a series of operations—for example, to compute violations of rules, count co-occurrences, or build language models. Hence, an ML cleaning solution would need to be innovative on how to avoid the complexity of these operations. HoloClean, for example uses techniques to prune the domain of database cell and apply judicious relaxations to the underlying model to achieve the required scalability. Older research tools struggled with how to handle the various types of errors, and how to combine the heterogeneous quality input (e.g., business and quality rules, policies, statistical signals in the data, etc.). The HoloClean framework advances the state of the art in two fundamental ways: (1) combining the logical rules and the statistical distribution of the data into one coherent probabilistic model; and (2) scaling the learning and inference process via a series of system and model optimizations, which allowed it to be deployed in census organizations and large commercial enterprises.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<h2>Data programming</h2>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Increasing the quality of the available data via either unification or cleaning, or both, is definitely an important and a promising way forward to leverage enterprise data assets. However, the quest for <em>more</em> data is not over, for two main reasons:</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n\\t<li>ML models for cleaning and unification often need training data and examples of possible errors or matching records. Depending completely on human labeling for these examples is simply a non-starter; as ML models get more complex and the underlying data sources get larger, the need for more data increases, the scale of which cannot be achieved by human experts.</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Even if we boosted the quality of the available data via unification and cleaning, it still might not be enough to power the even more complex analytics and predictions models (often built as a deep learning model).</li>\\r\\n</ol>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>An important paradigm for solving both these problems is the concept of <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.07723\">data programming</a>. In a nutshell, data programming techniques provide ways to “manufacture” data that we can feed to various learning and predictions tasks (even for ML data quality solutions). In practical terms, “data programming” unifies a class of techniques used for the programmatic creation of training data sets. In this category of tools, frameworks like <a href=\"https://hazyresearch.github.io/snorkel/\">Snorkel</a> show how to allow developers and data scientists to focus on writing labeling functions to programmatically label data, and then model the noise in the labels to effectively train high-quality models. While using data programming to train high-quality analytics models might be clear, we find it interesting how it is used internally in ML models for the data unification and cleaning we mentioned earlier in this post. For example, tools like <a href=\"http://www.tamr.com\">Tamr</a> leverage legacy rules written by customers to generate a large amount of (programmatically) labeled data to power its matching ML pipeline. In a <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.02285\">recent paper,</a> the HoloClean project showed how to use “data augmentation” to generate many examples of possible errors (from a small seed) to power its automatic error detection model.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h2>Market validation</h2>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The landscape of solutions we presented here for the quest for high-quality data have already been well validated in the market today.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n\\t<li>ML solutions for data unification such as Tamr and Informatica have been deployed at a large number of Fortune-1000 enterprises.</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Automatic data cleaning solutions such as HoloClean already have been deployed by multiple financial services and the census bureaus of various countries.</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>As the growing <a href=\"https://hazyresearch.github.io/snorkel/\">list of Snorkel users</a> suggests, data programming solutions are beginning to change the way data scientists provision ML models.</li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>As we get more mature in understanding the differences between the various problems of integration, cleaning, and automatic data generation, we will see real improvement in handling the valuable data assets in the enterprise.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Machine learning applications rely on three main components: models, data, and compute. A lot of articles are written about new breakthrough models, many of which are created by researchers who publish not only papers, but code written in popular open source libraries. In addition, recent advances in automated machine learning has resulted in many tools that can (partially) automate model selection and hyperparameter tuning. Thus, many cutting-edge models are now available to data scientists. Similarly, cloud platforms have made compute and hardware more accessible to developers.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Models are increasingly becoming commodities. As we noted in the survey results above, the reality is that a lack of high-quality training data remains the main bottleneck in most machine learning projects. We believe that machine learning engineers and data scientists will continue to spend most of their time creating and refining training data. Fortunately, help is on the way: as we’ve described in this post, we are finally beginning to see a class of technologies aimed squarely at the need for quality training data.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><strong>Related content</strong>:</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n\\t<li><a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/three-enablers-for-machine-learning-in-data-unification-trust-legacy-and-scale\">“Three enablers for machine learning in data unification: Trust, legacy, and scale”</a></li>\\r\\n\\t<li><a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/software-2-and-snorkel\">“Software 2.0 and Snorkel”</a></li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Ihab Ilyas on <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/why-data-preparation-frameworks-rely-on-human-in-the-loop-systems\">“Why data preparation frameworks rely on human-in-the-loop systems”</a>\\r\\n</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Alex Ratner on <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/creating-large-training-data-sets-quickly\">“Creating large training data sets quickly”</a>\\r\\n</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Jeff Jonas on <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/real-time-entity-resolution-made-accessible\">“Real-time entity resolution made accessible”</a>\\r\\n</li>\\r\\n\\t<li><a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/data-collection-and-data-markets-in-the-age-of-privacy-and-machine-learning\">“Data collection and data markets in the age of privacy and machine learning”</a></li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Continue reading <a href=\\'https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/the-quest-for-high-quality-data\\'>The quest for high-quality data.</a></p><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/oreilly/radar/atom/~4/geym9vzewXA\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>',\n",

In this short summary, I highlight results from a — survey (<a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/data/free/ai-adoption-in-the-enterprise.csp\"><em>AI Adoption in the Enterprise</em></a>) and describe recent trends in AI. Over the past decade, AI and machine learning (ML) have become extremely active research areas: the web site <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/\">arxiv.org</a> had an <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/assessing-progress-in-automation-technologies\">average daily upload</a> of around 100 machine learning papers in 2018.

One of their key findings is that the number of patent filings is growing fast: in fact, the ratio of patent filings to scientific publications indicates that patent filings are growing at a faster rate than publications.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<figure class=\"center\" id=\"id-6YOix\"><img alt=\"AI patent filings\" src=\"https://d3ansictanv2wj.cloudfront.net/Figure1-99dc7a06b497d2ea4f65863eb84a31ae.png\"><figcaption><span class=\"label\">Figure 1. </span>A <a href=\"https://www.wipo.int/publications/en/details.jsp?id=4386\">2019 WIPO Study</a> indicates that AI patent filings are growing at a faster rate than scientific publications.

Every few months there seems to be new deep learning models that establish records in many different natural language tasks and benchmarks.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<figure class=\"center\" id=\"id-RN4iK\"><img alt=\"progress in natural language models\" src=\"https://d3ansictanv2wj.cloudfront.net/Figure3-f52d29cf440e6310da7e8994e52877a8.png\"><figcaption><span class=\"label\">Figure 3. </span>Recent progress in natural language models. Source: Ben Lorica.</figcaption></figure>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Much of this research was done in the open, accompanied by open source code and pre-trained models. While applications of AI and machine learning and AI to text are not new, the accuracy of some of these models has drawn interest from practitioners and companies. Some of the most popular trainings, tutorials, and sessions at <a href=\"http://theaiconf.com\">our AI conferences</a> are ones that focus on text and natural language applications. It’s important to point out that, depending on your application or setting, <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/lessons-learned-building-natural-language-processing-systems-in-health-care\">you will likely need to tune these language models</a> for your specific domain and application.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>We continue to see improvements in tools for deep learning. Our surveys show that TensorFlow and PyTorch remain the most popular libraries. There are new open source tools like <a href=\"https://github.com/uber/ludwig\">Ludwig</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/intel-analytics/analytics-zoo\">Analytics Zoo</a> aimed at non-experts who want to begin using deep learning. We are also seeing tools from startups like <a href=\"https://www.wandb.com/\">Weights &amp; Bias</a> and <a href=\"https://determined.ai/\">Determined AI</a> (<em>full disclosure: I am an advisor to Determined AI</em>), and open source tools like <a href=\"https://github.com/IntelAI/nauta\">Nauta</a>, designed specifically for companies with growing teams of deep learning engineers and data scientists. These tools optimize compute resources, automate various stages of model building, and help users keep track and manage experiments.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>In our <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/data/free/ai-adoption-in-the-enterprise.csp\">survey</a> that drew more than 1,300 respondents, 22% signaled they are beginning to use <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/how-to-think-about-ai-and-machine-learning-technologies-and-their-roles-in-automation\">reinforcement learning</a> (RL), a form of ML that has been associated with recent prominent examples of “self-learning” systems. There are a couple of reasons for this. We are beginning to see more accessible tools for RL—open source, proprietary, and SaaS—and more importantly, <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/machine-learning-for-personalization\">companies like Netflix</a> are beginning to share <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/practical-applications-of-reinforcement-learning-in-industry\">use cases for RL</a>. Focusing on tooling for RL, there have been a variety of new tools that have come online over the last year. For example, Danny Lange and his team at Unity have released <a href=\"https://unity3d.com/machine-learning\">a suite of tools</a> that enable researchers and developers to “test new AI algorithms quickly and efficiently across a new generation of robotics, games, and beyond.”</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Let’s look at another one of these tools more closely. At <a href=\"http://theaiconf.com\">our AI conferences</a>, we’ve been offering a tutorial on an open source computing framework called <a href=\"https://github.com/ray-project/ray\">Ray</a>, developed by a team at UC Berkeley’s <a href=\"https://rise.cs.berkeley.edu/\">RISE Lab</a>.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<figure class=\"center\" id=\"id-RMkiq\"><img alt=\"Reinforcement Learning (using RLlib)\" src=\"https://d3ansictanv2wj.cloudfront.net/Figure4_2-5f01acc70b7fb60410501b87f1bb9a5f.jpg\"><figcaption><span class=\"label\">Figure 4. </span>Reinforcement Learning (using RLlib) is one of the popular uses cases for Ray. Source: Ben Lorica.</figcaption></figure>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>As I noted in a <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/the-evolution-and-expanding-utility-of-ray\">previous post</a>, Ray has <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bigdata/status/1128027141793140739\">grown across multiple fronts</a>: number of users, contributors, and use cases. Ray’s support for both stateless and stateful computations, and fine-grained control over scheduling allows users to implement a variety of services and applications on top of it, including RL. The RL library on top of Ray—RLlib—provides both a unified API for different types of RL training, and all of its algorithms are distributed. Thus, both RL <em>users</em> and RL <em>researchers</em> are already benefiting from using RLlib.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>There’s also exciting news on the hardware front. Last year we began <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/assessing-progress-in-automation-technologies\">tracking startups building specialized hardware for deep learning</a> and AI for training and inference as well as for use in edge devices and in data centers. We already have specialized hardware for <a href=\"https://habana.ai/news/\">inference</a> (and even training—TPUs on the Google Cloud Platform). Toward the latter part of this year, in the Q3/Q4 time frame, we expect more companies to begin releasing hardware that will greatly <a href=\"https://www.cerebras.net/\">accelerate training and inference</a> while being much more energy efficient. Given that we are in a highly empirical era for machine learning and AI, tools that can greatly accelerate training time while lowering costs will lead to many more experiments and potential breakthroughs.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>In our survey, we found more than 60% of companies were planning to invest some of their IT budget into AI. But the level of investment depended on how much experience a company already had with AI technologies. As you can see in Figure 5, those with a mature practice plan to invest a sizable portion of their IT budget into AI. There’s a strong likelihood that the gap between AI leaders and laggards will further widen.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<figure class=\"center\" id=\"id-5bMiM\"><img alt=\"investments in AI\" src=\"https://d3ansictanv2wj.cloudfront.net/Figure5-831ed3fd0b3ec501fe68fa42ae08e533.png\"><figcaption><span class=\"label\">Figure 5. </span>Planned investments in AI depends on the maturity level of a company. Source: Ben Lorica.</figcaption></figure>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>So, what is holding back adoption of AI? According to our survey, the answer depends on the maturity level of a company.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<figure class=\"center\" id=\"id-3aBiB\"><img alt=\"bottlenecks holding back adoption of AI\" src=\"https://d3ansictanv2wj.cloudfront.net/Figure6-a1c993a15e853380f881be0061bc2eea.png\"><figcaption><span class=\"label\">Figure 6. </span>Key bottlenecks holding back adoption of AI. Source: Ben Lorica.</figcaption></figure>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Those who are just getting started struggle with finding use cases or explaining the importance of AI. Also, we are far from General AI: we are at a stage where these technologies have to be tuned and targeted, and many AI systems work by augmenting domain experts. Thus, these technologies require training at all levels of an organization, not just in technical teams. It’s important that managers understand the capabilities and limitations of current AI technologies, and see how other companies are using AI. Take the case of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robotic_process_automation\">robotic process automation (RPA)</a>, a hot topic among enterprises. It’s really the people closest to tasks (“bottoms up approach”) who can best identify areas where RPA is most suitable.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>On the other hand, those with mature AI practices struggle with lack of data and lack of skilled people. Let’s look at the skills gap more closely in Figure 7.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<figure class=\"center\" id=\"id-5AEiz\"><img alt=\"Skills gap in AI\" src=\"https://d3ansictanv2wj.cloudfront.net/Figure7-32b524413998cb22b29d82febed10a77.png\"><figcaption><span class=\"label\">Figure 7. </span>Skills gap in AI. Source: Ben Lorica.</figcaption></figure>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Skills requirements depend on the level of maturity as well. Companies with more mature AI practices have less trouble finding use cases and have less need for data scientists. However, the need for data and infrastructure engineers cuts across companies. It’s important to remember that much of AI today still requires large amounts of training data to train large models that require large amounts of compute resources. I <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/becoming-a-machine-learning-company-means-investing-in-foundational-technologies\">recently wrote about</a> the requisite foundational technologies needed to succeed in machine learning and AI.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>As the use of AI technologies grows within companies, we will need better tools for machine learning model development, governance, and operations. We are beginning to see tools that can automate many stages of a machine learning pipeline, help <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/specialized-tools-for-machine-learning-development-and-model-governance-are-becoming-essential\">manage the ML model development</a> process, and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UADvHfcMJek\">search through the space of possible neural network architectures</a>. Given the level of excitement around ML and AI, we expect tools in these areas to improve and gain widespread adoption.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<figure class=\"center\" id=\"id-3GLim\"><img alt=\"Automation and model development tools\" src=\"https://d3ansictanv2wj.cloudfront.net/Figure8-dc0ea9f7f11121ef26121d28ae8b563d.png\"><figcaption><span class=\"label\">Figure 8. </span>Automation and model development tools are growing in popularity. Source: Ben Lorica.</figcaption></figure>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>With the growing interest in AI among companies, this is a great time to be building tools for ML. When we asked our survey respondents, “Which tools are you planning to incorporate into your ML workflows within the next 12 months?”, we found:</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n\\t<li>48% wanted tools for model visualization</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>43% needed tools for automated model search and hyperparameter tuning</li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Companies are realizing that ML and AI is much more than optimizing a business or a statistical metric. Over the past year, I’ve tried to summarize some of these considerations <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/managing-risk-in-machine-learning\">under the umbrella of “risk management,”</a> a term and practice area many companies are already familiar with. <a href=\"https://github.com/IBM/AIF360\">Researchers</a> and <a href=\"https://conferences.oreilly.com/artificial-intelligence/ai-ny/public/schedule/detail/73864\">companies</a> are beginning to release tools and frameworks to explain various techniques they are using to develop “responsible AI.” When we asked our survey respondents, “What kinds of risks do you check for during ML model building and deployment?”, we found the following:</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n\\t<li>45% assessed model interpretability and explainability</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>41% indicated that they had tests for fairness and bias</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>35% checked for privacy</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>34% looked into safety and reliability issues</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>27% tested for security vulnerabilities</li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>A word about data security. In the age of AI, there are situations where data <strong><em>integrity</em></strong> will be just as critical as data <strong><em>security</em></strong>. That’s because AI systems are highly dependent on data used for training. Building data infrastructure that can keep track of data governance and lineage will be very important, not only for security and quality assurance audits, but also for compliance with existing and future regulations.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<figure class=\"center\" id=\"id-6ZXig\"><img alt=\"Data privacy and security in the age of AI\" src=\"https://d3ansictanv2wj.cloudfront.net/Figure9-e75480de3b7332157b93f4009cc23661.png\"><figcaption><span class=\"label\">Figure 9. </span>Data privacy and security in the age of AI.

The past decade has produced a flurry of research results, and we are beginning to see a wide selection of accessible tools aimed at companies and developers. But we are still in the early stages of AI adoption, and much work remains in many areas on the tooling front. With that said, many startups, companies, and researchers are hard at work to improve the ecosystems of tools for ML and AI. Over the next 12 months, I expect to see a lot of progress in tools that can ease ML development, governance, and operations.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><strong>Related content:</strong></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n\\t<li>\\r\\n<a href=\"https://conferences.oreilly.com/artificial-intelligence/ai-ca/public/schedule/detail/77041\">“Modern Deep Learning: Tools and Techniques”</a> - a new tutorial at the Artificial Intelligence conference in San Jose.</li>\\r\\n\\t<li><a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/becoming-a-machine-learning-company-means-investing-in-foundational-technologies\">“Becoming a machine learning company means investing in foundational technologies”</a></li>\\r\\n\\t<li><a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/lessons-learned-building-natural-language-processing-systems-in-health-care\">“Lessons learned building natural language processing systems in health care”</a></li>\\r\\n\\t<li><a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/the-evolution-and-expanding-utility-of-ray\">“The evolution and expanding utility of Ray”</a></li>\\r\\n\\t<li><a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/practical-applications-of-reinforcement-learning-in-industry\">“Practical applications of reinforcement learning in industry”</a></li>\\r\\n<li><a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/specialized-tools-for-machine-learning-development-and-model-governance-are-becoming-essential\">“Specialized tools for machine learning development and model governance are becoming essential”</a></li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n<p>Continue reading <a href=\\'https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/ai-adoption-is-being-fueled-by-an-improved-tool-ecosystem\\'>AI adoption is being fueled by an improved tool ecosystem.</a></p><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/oreilly/radar/atom/~4/zvIpjkng3CQ\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>'}],\n",

Every few months there seems to be new deep learning models that establish records in many different natural language tasks and benchmarks.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<figure class=\"center\" id=\"id-RN4iK\"><img alt=\"progress in natural language models\" src=\"https://d3ansictanv2wj.cloudfront.net/Figure3-f52d29cf440e6310da7e8994e52877a8.png\"><figcaption><span class=\"label\">Figure 3. </span>Recent progress in natural language models. Source: Ben Lorica.</figcaption></figure>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Much of this research was done in the open, accompanied by open source code and pre-trained models. While applications of AI and machine learning and AI to text are not new, the accuracy of some of these models has drawn interest from practitioners and companies. Some of the most popular trainings, tutorials, and sessions at <a href=\"http://theaiconf.com\">our AI conferences</a> are ones that focus on text and natural language applications. It’s important to point out that, depending on your application or setting, <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/lessons-learned-building-natural-language-processing-systems-in-health-care\">you will likely need to tune these language models</a> for your specific domain and application.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>We continue to see improvements in tools for deep learning. Our surveys show that TensorFlow and PyTorch remain the most popular libraries. There are new open source tools like <a href=\"https://github.com/uber/ludwig\">Ludwig</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/intel-analytics/analytics-zoo\">Analytics Zoo</a> aimed at non-experts who want to begin using deep learning. We are also seeing tools from startups like <a href=\"https://www.wandb.com/\">Weights &amp; Bias</a> and <a href=\"https://determined.ai/\">Determined AI</a> (<em>full disclosure: I am an advisor to Determined AI</em>), and open source tools like <a href=\"https://github.com/IntelAI/nauta\">Nauta</a>, designed specifically for companies with growing teams of deep learning engineers and data scientists. These tools optimize compute resources, automate various stages of model building, and help users keep track and manage experiments.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>In our <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/data/free/ai-adoption-in-the-enterprise.csp\">survey</a> that drew more than 1,300 respondents, 22% signaled they are beginning to use <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/how-to-think-about-ai-and-machine-learning-technologies-and-their-roles-in-automation\">reinforcement learning</a> (RL), a form of ML that has been associated with recent prominent examples of “self-learning” systems. There are a couple of reasons for this. We are beginning to see more accessible tools for RL—open source, proprietary, and SaaS—and more importantly, <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/machine-learning-for-personalization\">companies like Netflix</a> are beginning to share <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/practical-applications-of-reinforcement-learning-in-industry\">use cases for RL</a>. Focusing on tooling for RL, there have been a variety of new tools that have come online over the last year. For example, Danny Lange and his team at Unity have released <a href=\"https://unity3d.com/machine-learning\">a suite of tools</a> that enable researchers and developers to “test new AI algorithms quickly and efficiently across a new generation of robotics, games, and beyond.”</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Let’s look at another one of these tools more closely. At <a href=\"http://theaiconf.com\">our AI conferences</a>, we’ve been offering a tutorial on an open source computing framework called <a href=\"https://github.com/ray-project/ray\">Ray</a>, developed by a team at UC Berkeley’s <a href=\"https://rise.cs.berkeley.edu/\">RISE Lab</a>.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<figure class=\"center\" id=\"id-RMkiq\"><img alt=\"Reinforcement Learning (using RLlib)\" src=\"https://d3ansictanv2wj.cloudfront.net/Figure4_2-5f01acc70b7fb60410501b87f1bb9a5f.jpg\"><figcaption><span class=\"label\">Figure 4. </span>Reinforcement Learning (using RLlib) is one of the popular uses cases for Ray. Source: Ben Lorica.</figcaption></figure>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>As I noted in a <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/the-evolution-and-expanding-utility-of-ray\">previous post</a>, Ray has <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bigdata/status/1128027141793140739\">grown across multiple fronts</a>: number of users, contributors, and use cases. Ray’s support for both stateless and stateful computations, and fine-grained control over scheduling allows users to implement a variety of services and applications on top of it, including RL. The RL library on top of Ray—RLlib—provides both a unified API for different types of RL training, and all of its algorithms are distributed. Thus, both RL <em>users</em> and RL <em>researchers</em> are already benefiting from using RLlib.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>There’s also exciting news on the hardware front. Last year we began <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/assessing-progress-in-automation-technologies\">tracking startups building specialized hardware for deep learning</a> and AI for training and inference as well as for use in edge devices and in data centers. We already have specialized hardware for <a href=\"https://habana.ai/news/\">inference</a> (and even training—TPUs on the Google Cloud Platform). Toward the latter part of this year, in the Q3/Q4 time frame, we expect more companies to begin releasing hardware that will greatly <a href=\"https://www.cerebras.net/\">accelerate training and inference</a> while being much more energy efficient. Given that we are in a highly empirical era for machine learning and AI, tools that can greatly accelerate training time while lowering costs will lead to many more experiments and potential breakthroughs.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>In our survey, we found more than 60% of companies were planning to invest some of their IT budget into AI. But the level of investment depended on how much experience a company already had with AI technologies. As you can see in Figure 5, those with a mature practice plan to invest a sizable portion of their IT budget into AI. There’s a strong likelihood that the gap between AI leaders and laggards will further widen.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<figure class=\"center\" id=\"id-5bMiM\"><img alt=\"investments in AI\" src=\"https://d3ansictanv2wj.cloudfront.net/Figure5-831ed3fd0b3ec501fe68fa42ae08e533.png\"><figcaption><span class=\"label\">Figure 5. </span>Planned investments in AI depends on the maturity level of a company. Source: Ben Lorica.</figcaption></figure>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>So, what is holding back adoption of AI? According to our survey, the answer depends on the maturity level of a company.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<figure class=\"center\" id=\"id-3aBiB\"><img alt=\"bottlenecks holding back adoption of AI\" src=\"https://d3ansictanv2wj.cloudfront.net/Figure6-a1c993a15e853380f881be0061bc2eea.png\"><figcaption><span class=\"label\">Figure 6. </span>Key bottlenecks holding back adoption of AI. Source: Ben Lorica.</figcaption></figure>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Those who are just getting started struggle with finding use cases or explaining the importance of AI. Also, we are far from General AI: we are at a stage where these technologies have to be tuned and targeted, and many AI systems work by augmenting domain experts. Thus, these technologies require training at all levels of an organization, not just in technical teams. It’s important that managers understand the capabilities and limitations of current AI technologies, and see how other companies are using AI. Take the case of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robotic_process_automation\">robotic process automation (RPA)</a>, a hot topic among enterprises. It’s really the people closest to tasks (“bottoms up approach”) who can best identify areas where RPA is most suitable.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>On the other hand, those with mature AI practices struggle with lack of data and lack of skilled people. Let’s look at the skills gap more closely in Figure 7.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<figure class=\"center\" id=\"id-5AEiz\"><img alt=\"Skills gap in AI\" src=\"https://d3ansictanv2wj.cloudfront.net/Figure7-32b524413998cb22b29d82febed10a77.png\"><figcaption><span class=\"label\">Figure 7. </span>Skills gap in AI. Source: Ben Lorica.</figcaption></figure>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Skills requirements depend on the level of maturity as well. Companies with more mature AI practices have less trouble finding use cases and have less need for data scientists. However, the need for data and infrastructure engineers cuts across companies. It’s important to remember that much of AI today still requires large amounts of training data to train large models that require large amounts of compute resources. I <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/becoming-a-machine-learning-company-means-investing-in-foundational-technologies\">recently wrote about</a> the requisite foundational technologies needed to succeed in machine learning and AI.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>As the use of AI technologies grows within companies, we will need better tools for machine learning model development, governance, and operations. We are beginning to see tools that can automate many stages of a machine learning pipeline, help <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/specialized-tools-for-machine-learning-development-and-model-governance-are-becoming-essential\">manage the ML model development</a> process, and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UADvHfcMJek\">search through the space of possible neural network architectures</a>. Given the level of excitement around ML and AI, we expect tools in these areas to improve and gain widespread adoption.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<figure class=\"center\" id=\"id-3GLim\"><img alt=\"Automation and model development tools\" src=\"https://d3ansictanv2wj.cloudfront.net/Figure8-dc0ea9f7f11121ef26121d28ae8b563d.png\"><figcaption><span class=\"label\">Figure 8. </span>Automation and model development tools are growing in popularity. Source: Ben Lorica.</figcaption></figure>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>With the growing interest in AI among companies, this is a great time to be building tools for ML. When we asked our survey respondents, “Which tools are you planning to incorporate into your ML workflows within the next 12 months?”, we found:</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n\\t<li>48% wanted tools for model visualization</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>43% needed tools for automated model search and hyperparameter tuning</li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Companies are realizing that ML and AI is much more than optimizing a business or a statistical metric. Over the past year, I’ve tried to summarize some of these considerations <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/managing-risk-in-machine-learning\">under the umbrella of “risk management,”</a> a term and practice area many companies are already familiar with. <a href=\"https://github.com/IBM/AIF360\">Researchers</a> and <a href=\"https://conferences.oreilly.com/artificial-intelligence/ai-ny/public/schedule/detail/73864\">companies</a> are beginning to release tools and frameworks to explain various techniques they are using to develop “responsible AI.” When we asked our survey respondents, “What kinds of risks do you check for during ML model building and deployment?”, we found the following:</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n\\t<li>45% assessed model interpretability and explainability</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>41% indicated that they had tests for fairness and bias</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>35% checked for privacy</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>34% looked into safety and reliability issues</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>27% tested for security vulnerabilities</li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>A word about data security. In the age of AI, there are situations where data <strong><em>integrity</em></strong> will be just as critical as data <strong><em>security</em></strong>. That’s because AI systems are highly dependent on data used for training. Building data infrastructure that can keep track of data governance and lineage will be very important, not only for security and quality assurance audits, but also for compliance with existing and future regulations.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<figure class=\"center\" id=\"id-6ZXig\"><img alt=\"Data privacy and security in the age of AI\" src=\"https://d3ansictanv2wj.cloudfront.net/Figure9-e75480de3b7332157b93f4009cc23661.png\"><figcaption><span class=\"label\">Figure 9. </span>Data privacy and security in the age of AI.

The past decade has produced a flurry of research results, and we are beginning to see a wide selection of accessible tools aimed at companies and developers. But we are still in the early stages of AI adoption, and much work remains in many areas on the tooling front. With that said, many startups, companies, and researchers are hard at work to improve the ecosystems of tools for ML and AI. Over the next 12 months, I expect to see a lot of progress in tools that can ease ML development, governance, and operations.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><strong>Related content:</strong></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n\\t<li>\\r\\n<a href=\"https://conferences.oreilly.com/artificial-intelligence/ai-ca/public/schedule/detail/77041\">“Modern Deep Learning: Tools and Techniques”</a> - a new tutorial at the Artificial Intelligence conference in San Jose.</li>\\r\\n\\t<li><a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/becoming-a-machine-learning-company-means-investing-in-foundational-technologies\">“Becoming a machine learning company means investing in foundational technologies”</a></li>\\r\\n\\t<li><a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/lessons-learned-building-natural-language-processing-systems-in-health-care\">“Lessons learned building natural language processing systems in health care”</a></li>\\r\\n\\t<li><a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/the-evolution-and-expanding-utility-of-ray\">“The evolution and expanding utility of Ray”</a></li>\\r\\n\\t<li><a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/practical-applications-of-reinforcement-learning-in-industry\">“Practical applications of reinforcement learning in industry”</a></li>\\r\\n<li><a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/specialized-tools-for-machine-learning-development-and-model-governance-are-becoming-essential\">“Specialized tools for machine learning development and model governance are becoming essential”</a></li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n<p>Continue reading <a href=\\'https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/ai-adoption-is-being-fueled-by-an-improved-tool-ecosystem\\'>AI adoption is being fueled by an improved tool ecosystem.</a></p><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/oreilly/radar/atom/~4/zvIpjkng3CQ\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>',\n",

The value that SRE provides to a business might come in various different forms. It might be that you\\'re currently having problems with reliability, with your operational load, your operational costs. There is something you need to do in order to be able to scale up and be more effective in your environment. SRE allows you to say, \"Are we reliable enough? And if we\\'re not, what are we going to do about it?\"</p></blockquote>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<h2>Biggest roadblock to doing SRE </h2>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<blockquote>\\r\\n<p>One of the things I see being a significant barrier is the psychological safety required in order to be confident working in production, and being responsible for production, and being responsible for engineering and production. At Google, we have this locked down. We\\'ve got the concept of blameless postmortems, but it\\'s not just that. You have this confidence that if you\\'re toiling too hard, you can go to your leadership and say, \"Help.\" And your leadership will say, \"Absolutely. That\\'s a problem. We\\'ll help you drive that down.\"</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>But in another organization, you might go to leadership and say, \"Help, we have too much toil right now.\" They might say, \"Okay, so you\\'re going to work harder, aren\\'t you?\" I think one of the things we have at Google, which I would love to see in more organizations, is the implementation and the feeling of psychological safety. That if you have problems, it\\'s not your fault that you have problems. You can go to leadership, you can go to your peers, you can go to your development teams, and you can say, \"Let\\'s work together to make this a better place for everyone.\"</p>\\r\\n</blockquote>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<h2>Keeping the post-mortem blameless</h2>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<blockquote><p>The reason you really want a blameless postmortem is because as soon as you blame a system, or a human, or a thing that happened, you stop looking for all of those other causes for what went wrong.</p></blockquote>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<h2>Signs of a successful SRE team</h2>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<blockquote>\\r\\n<p>What you want to see from a successful site reliability engineering team is that they know how reliable their system is. They have a plan for how to improve it over time, or reduce their toil over time; they\\'re delivering on that plan; and those deliverables are actually causing a change.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>So, a successful SRE team is able to demonstrate the impact of the work they\\'re doing. If you have an SRE team that was running a reliable service last year and running a reliable service this year, but can\\'t tell you what projects they completed in that time that actually had a measurable impact, it\\'s like, what are we doing here?</p>\\r\\n</blockquote>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<h2>Is it possible to automate yourself out of a job?</h2>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<blockquote><p>If you find SREs who have actually managed to automate themselves out of a job, you have struck gold. Because they now know how to do this for other teams, they know how to scale up their work, and you should grab onto these people with both hands and say, \"You are the best SREs we have right now. Help everyone else achieve your success.\"</p></blockquote>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><em>This post is a part of a collaboration between O’Reilly and Google.

You can go to leadership, you can go to your peers, you can go to your development teams, and you can say, \"Let\\'s work together to make this a better place for everyone.\"</p>\\r\\n</blockquote>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<h2>Keeping the post-mortem blameless</h2>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<blockquote><p>The reason you really want a blameless postmortem is because as soon as you blame a system, or a human, or a thing that happened, you stop looking for all of those other causes for what went wrong.</p></blockquote>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<h2>Signs of a successful SRE team</h2>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<blockquote>\\r\\n<p>What you want to see from a successful site reliability engineering team is that they know how reliable their system is. They have a plan for how to improve it over time, or reduce their toil over time; they\\'re delivering on that plan; and those deliverables are actually causing a change.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>So, a successful SRE team is able to demonstrate the impact of the work they\\'re doing. If you have an SRE team that was running a reliable service last year and running a reliable service this year, but can\\'t tell you what projects they completed in that time that actually had a measurable impact, it\\'s like, what are we doing here?</p>\\r\\n</blockquote>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<h2>Is it possible to automate yourself out of a job?</h2>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<blockquote><p>If you find SREs who have actually managed to automate themselves out of a job, you have struck gold. Because they now know how to do this for other teams, they know how to scale up their work, and you should grab onto these people with both hands and say, \"You are the best SREs we have right now. Help everyone else achieve your success.\"</p></blockquote>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><em>This post is a part of a collaboration between O’Reilly and Google.

The \"flash crash\" of 2010 was an economic event created purely by the software that runs our financial systems going awry. However, the real danger of the Skynet moment isn’t what happens when the software fails, but when it is working properly: when it’s maximizing short-term shareholder value, without considering any other aspects of the world we live in. Even when our systems are working, they’re maximizing the wrong function.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Charlie Stross makes a similar point in “<a href=\"http://www.antipope.org/charlie/blog-static/2018/01/dude-you-broke-the-future.html\">Dude you broke the future</a>,” arguing that modern corporations are “paper clip maximizers.” He’s referring to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Bostrom\">Nick Bostrom’s</a> <a href=\"https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Paperclip_maximizer\">thought experiment</a> about what could go wrong with an artificial general intelligence (AGI). If told to maximize the process of making paper clips, it could decide that humans were inessential. It was told to make paper clips, lots of them, and nothing is going to stop it. Like O’Reilly, Stross says the process is already happening: we’re already living in a world of “paper clip maximizers.” Businesses maximize stock prices without regard for cost, whether that cost is human, environmental, or something else. That process of optimization is out of control—and may well make our planet uninhabitable long before we know how to build a paper clip-optimizing AI.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The paper clip maximizer is a provocative tool for thinking about the future of artificial intelligence and machine learning–though not for the reasons Bostrom thinks. As O’Reilly and Stross point out, paper clip maximization is already happening in our economic systems, which have evolved a kind of connectivity that lets them work without oversight. It’s already happening in our corporations, where short-term profit creates a world that is worse for everyone. Automated trading systems largely predate modern AI, though they have no doubt incorporated it.

We don’t have–and may never have–an artificial general intelligence, or even a more limited artificial intelligence that will destroy the world by maximizing paper clips. As Andrew Ng has said, we\\'re being asked to <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/brandlab/2015/05/andrew-ng-deep-learning-mandate-humans-not-just-machines/\">worry about overpopulation on Mars</a>. We have more immediate problems to solve. What we do have are organizations that are already maximizing their own paper clips, and that aren’t intelligent by any standard. That’s a concrete problem we need to deal with now. Talking about future paper clips might be interesting or thrilling, but in reality, it’s a way of avoiding dealing with our present paper clips. As Stross points out, Elon Musk is one of the recent popularizers of paper clip anxiety; yet, he has already built his own maximizers for batteries and space flights. It’s much easier to wax philosophical about a hypothetical problem than to deal with a planet that is gradually overheating. It’s a lot more fun, and a lot less threatening, to think about the dangers of a hypothetical future AI than to think about the economic, political, sociological, and environmental problems that face us now—even if those two sets of problems are really the same.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The argument that Stross and O’Reilly make is central to how we think about AI ethics—and not just AI ethics, but business ethics.

In addition to <a href=\"https://landing.google.com/sre/sre-book/chapters/monitoring-distributed-systems/\">an SRE book chapter</a>, other site reliability engineers at Google <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/199PqyG3UsyXlwieHaqbGiWVa8eMWi8zzAn0YfcApr8Q/edit#heading=h.fs3knmjt7fjy\">have written on the topic of alerting philosophy</a>. However, the nuances of how to structure well-reasoned alerting are varied and contentious. For example, traditional \"wisdom\" argues that cause-based alerts are <em>bad</em>, while symptom-based or SLO-based alerts are <em>good</em>.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Navigating the dichotomy of symptom-based and cause-based alerting adds undue toil to the process of writing alerts: rather than focusing on writing a meaningful alert that addresses a need for running the system, the dichotomy brings anxiety around deciding whether an alert condition falls on the “correct” side of this dichotomy.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Instead, consider approaching alerting as a hierarchy of the alerts available to you: reactive, symptom-based alerts—typically based on your SLOs—form the foundation of this hierarchy. As systems mature and achieve higher availability targets, other types of alerts can add to your system\\'s overall reliability without adding excessive toil. Using this approach, you can identify value in different types of alerts, while aiming for a comprehensive alerting setup.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>As detailed below, by analyzing their existing alerts and organizing them according to a hierarchy, then iterating as appropriate, service owners can improve the reliability of their systems and reduce the toil and overhead associated with traditional cause-based and investigative alerts.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h2>Basic alerting concepts</h2>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>This proposed alerting maturity hierarchy builds upon a few basic definitions of and assumptions about alerting.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<h3>What is an alert?</h3>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>For the purposes of this discussion, we consider an alert to be a page, ticket, Slack notification, or automated email that\\'s generated from the system. For example, a user escalation would not be considered an alert.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<h3>Why do we alert?</h3>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>An alert calls for human action. The system can no longer handle a situation on its own, and requires the creative mind of a human. This criteria also covers situations in which the system <em>could</em> handle the situation on its own, but still needs to involve a human—for example, because unsupervised automatic resolution is too dangerous.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>This also means that an alert might be benign. The system alerted a human because the system couldn’t determine what to do next. But a human might determine that everything is in order and no action should be taken. If we could automatically make that determination, we wouldn’t need the alert.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<h3>What is a <em>good</em> alert?</h3>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The valuation of whether or not an alert is \"good\" is inherently subjective—an alert is good if the human recipient finds it good, and every other evaluation criterion is a proxy. That being said, there are some fairly common proxies:</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n\\t<li>\\r\\n<strong>Timeliness: </strong>Did the alert arrive on time, rather than too long after the event to be useful?</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>\\r\\n<strong>Correct delivery: </strong>Was the alert sent to the correct human, or was it delivered to an adjacent, but incorrect team?</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>\\r\\n<strong>Documentation: </strong>Was the alert content relevant to the issue a human needs to evaluate, or did it contain a generic and unhelpful description?</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>\\r\\n<strong>Actionability: </strong>Did the alert prompt any action (other than simply acknowledging the alert)?</li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h2>Proposed hierarchy</h2>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Now that we know why we alert and have a working definition of a good alert, we propose a pyramid-shaped hierarchy of alerting maturity. This pyramid is evocative of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow%27s_hierarchy_of_needs\">Maslow\\'s hierarchy of needs</a> and the <a href=\"https://landing.google.com/sre/sre-book/chapters/part3/\">service reliability hierarchy</a> posed in <a href=\"https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/site-reliability-engineering/9781491929117/\">the SRE book</a>. In the proposed hierarchy shown in Figure 1, we reason about alerts in three categories: reactive alerts, proactive alerts, and investigative alerts. You should only implement proactive alerts once you have a solid foundation of reactive alerts, and you can\\'t think about investigative alerts until both your reactive and proactive alerts are in a good state.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<figure class=\"center\" id=\"id-6KGiJ\"><img alt=\"Alerting maturity hierarchy\" src=\"https://d3ansictanv2wj.cloudfront.net/Figure1-e274c0c6dd92bfb22a5f7e3cc263be88.png\"><figcaption><span class=\"label\">Figure 1. </span>Alerting maturity hierarchy. Source: Google.</figcaption></figure>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>While thinking about alerts in terms of cause-based versus symptom-based is somewhat orthogonal to this hierarchy, it may be useful to think of symptom-based alerts as falling under the reactive alerts category and cause-based alerts as falling under the proactive and investigative alerts categories.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h3>Types of alerts</h3>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>You can use the descriptions of alert types and example scenarios below to reason about corresponding sets of alerts for your service.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h4>Reactive alerts</h4>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Your business goals are <em>currently in immediate danger</em>. SLO-based alerting is a great example of reactive alerting.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><strong>Example scenario:</strong> Alert when you\\'re in danger of breaching an SLO. A good reactive alert fires when (to the best of our knowledge) there is an <em>imminent danger</em> of an SLO breach. This allows the human recipient to react to the danger before all is lost.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>If you haven\\'t set up reactive alerts for your service, it\\'s likely that most of your uptime-affecting incidents result from issues not captured in SLO alerts. After establishing a baseline of reactive alerts, your service should alert a human before the service exceeds its error budget. If an alert only fires when you have already violated your SLO, it\\'s too late to take action.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Note that “<em>to be in danger of</em>” does not mean the anticipated event will definitely happen. For example, the SLO burndown can recover on its own. It only means that with information available at the point of the alert, there’s a reasonable expectation the SLO will be violated if nobody takes action.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Of course, crafting a comprehensive set of reactive alerts is not straightforward. Not every situation that <em>could</em> endanger your SLO is worth alerting on.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h4>Proactive alerts</h4>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Your business goals are probably <em>going to be in danger soon but aren\\'t in immediate danger</em>—you\\'re on trend to hit problems. You aren’t burning error budget in a way that strongly indicates you’re in danger of breaching your SLO. Quota alerts are a good example of proactive alerts.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><strong>Example scenario:</strong> If you use a storage system that rejects write requests when you hit 100%, configure your alerting to warn you a week before you hit 100%, at which point you should proactively respond to the situation. For example, you could set up a garbage collection job to clear out extra quota usage. That way, your storage system never fills up completely and starts rejecting writes.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>In this scenario and similar ones, a reactive alert might complement your proactive alert. For example, if you\\'re in danger of hitting the 100% quota mark, the system would also trigger a reactive alert that your system is in danger of breaching its SLO.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h4>Investigative alerts</h4>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Your system is in some sort of unusual state, which may contribute to a partial failure now and/or a threat to a business goal later. For example, a server binary is restarting occasionally without a known cause, but no traffic is being affected because of redundancy or retries. Investigative alerts are particularly useful when the problem could be a sudden shift in user behavior. More often, investigative alerts indicate a service failure that is out of scope for any SLOs.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Examples:</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n\\t<li>Fluctuations in the number of users loading photos on a photo sharing app</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Sudden changes in usage patterns, such as a dramatic increase in 404 responses at the expense of all other response codes</li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><strong>Example scenario:</strong> Before developing investigative alerts, the system fails and sends an alert stating \"the compute jobs are crash-looping.\" After writing investigative alerts, the system more clearly states “the rate of 500 HTTP errors in the front end is growing dramatically and the jobs are crash-looping,” providing more footing to investigate the symptoms of the incident.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Recall that alerts necessarily involve human judgement and uncertainty. The alert fires because the system does not know what step to take next.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h3>How reactive, proactive, and investigative alerts work together</h3>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><strong>Think of these three alert types as a hierarchy.</strong> You should only move to higher levels of the pyramid if the foundations below are solid and not causing undue toil.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><strong>These alerts don’t need to be received by the same group of people.</strong> For example, in SRE-managed products, due to the reactive nature of oncall, it\\'s clear that SREs should care about reactive alerts when they directly correspond to business needs. However, you might route proactive and investigative alerts across SRE and product development teams more liberally.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><strong>Not all alerts merit the same level of urgency or consistency. </strong>For example, to ensure a timely response, you may only want to fire investigative alerts during business hours.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h2>Bad setups and their remedies</h2>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Each type of alert serves a purpose, but as with any powerful tool, there is a risk of misusing them. Below are some common anti-patterns and their remedies using a maturity hierarchy-based approach.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h3>Only investigative alerts</h3>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>In this scenario, investigative alerts account for most or all of the primary service alerting. This anti-pattern has led to much of the polarized language characterizing cause-based alerting as bad. As shown in Figure 2, these alerts aren\\'t supported by a foundation of reactive and proactive alerts.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<figure class=\"center\" id=\"id-q4iAV\"><img alt=\"investigative alerts\" src=\"https://d3ansictanv2wj.cloudfront.net/Figure2-d9a63c0fd3e5fed89275f98b6aa0c01c.png\"><figcaption><span class=\"label\">Figure 2. </span>Only investigative alerts.

This results in worse uptime and more toil and burnout, harming both short- and long-term system reliability.

As described in the first anti-pattern above, cause-based alerts are problematic if they\\'re the only type of alerting you use. When used in conjunction with other types of alerts, cause-based notifications can provide a deeper understanding of the system and improve its robustness. But your aggregated alerting must not lead to toil, and when it does, we recommend revisiting your alerting strategy.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>All too frequently, we treat alerting as a haunted graveyard: we shy away from removing an alert (because what if it catches something important?!) just as much we shy away from enabling a new alert (because what if it causes toil?!).</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Throughout SRE history, alerting setups have been built based mostly on opinion and conjecture, rather than by actually analyzing which setups best serve the end goal of running reliable services with minimal toil.

In addition to <a href=\"https://landing.google.com/sre/sre-book/chapters/monitoring-distributed-systems/\">an SRE book chapter</a>, other site reliability engineers at Google <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/199PqyG3UsyXlwieHaqbGiWVa8eMWi8zzAn0YfcApr8Q/edit#heading=h.fs3knmjt7fjy\">have written on the topic of alerting philosophy</a>. However, the nuances of how to structure well-reasoned alerting are varied and contentious. For example, traditional \"wisdom\" argues that cause-based alerts are <em>bad</em>, while symptom-based or SLO-based alerts are <em>good</em>.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Navigating the dichotomy of symptom-based and cause-based alerting adds undue toil to the process of writing alerts: rather than focusing on writing a meaningful alert that addresses a need for running the system, the dichotomy brings anxiety around deciding whether an alert condition falls on the “correct” side of this dichotomy.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Instead, consider approaching alerting as a hierarchy of the alerts available to you: reactive, symptom-based alerts—typically based on your SLOs—form the foundation of this hierarchy. As systems mature and achieve higher availability targets, other types of alerts can add to your system\\'s overall reliability without adding excessive toil. Using this approach, you can identify value in different types of alerts, while aiming for a comprehensive alerting setup.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>As detailed below, by analyzing their existing alerts and organizing them according to a hierarchy, then iterating as appropriate, service owners can improve the reliability of their systems and reduce the toil and overhead associated with traditional cause-based and investigative alerts.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h2>Basic alerting concepts</h2>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>This proposed alerting maturity hierarchy builds upon a few basic definitions of and assumptions about alerting.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<h3>What is an alert?</h3>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>For the purposes of this discussion, we consider an alert to be a page, ticket, Slack notification, or automated email that\\'s generated from the system. For example, a user escalation would not be considered an alert.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<h3>Why do we alert?</h3>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>An alert calls for human action. The system can no longer handle a situation on its own, and requires the creative mind of a human. This criteria also covers situations in which the system <em>could</em> handle the situation on its own, but still needs to involve a human—for example, because unsupervised automatic resolution is too dangerous.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>This also means that an alert might be benign. The system alerted a human because the system couldn’t determine what to do next. But a human might determine that everything is in order and no action should be taken. If we could automatically make that determination, we wouldn’t need the alert.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<h3>What is a <em>good</em> alert?</h3>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The valuation of whether or not an alert is \"good\" is inherently subjective—an alert is good if the human recipient finds it good, and every other evaluation criterion is a proxy. That being said, there are some fairly common proxies:</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n\\t<li>\\r\\n<strong>Timeliness: </strong>Did the alert arrive on time, rather than too long after the event to be useful?</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>\\r\\n<strong>Correct delivery: </strong>Was the alert sent to the correct human, or was it delivered to an adjacent, but incorrect team?</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>\\r\\n<strong>Documentation: </strong>Was the alert content relevant to the issue a human needs to evaluate, or did it contain a generic and unhelpful description?</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>\\r\\n<strong>Actionability: </strong>Did the alert prompt any action (other than simply acknowledging the alert)?</li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h2>Proposed hierarchy</h2>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Now that we know why we alert and have a working definition of a good alert, we propose a pyramid-shaped hierarchy of alerting maturity. This pyramid is evocative of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow%27s_hierarchy_of_needs\">Maslow\\'s hierarchy of needs</a> and the <a href=\"https://landing.google.com/sre/sre-book/chapters/part3/\">service reliability hierarchy</a> posed in <a href=\"https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/site-reliability-engineering/9781491929117/\">the SRE book</a>. In the proposed hierarchy shown in Figure 1, we reason about alerts in three categories: reactive alerts, proactive alerts, and investigative alerts. You should only implement proactive alerts once you have a solid foundation of reactive alerts, and you can\\'t think about investigative alerts until both your reactive and proactive alerts are in a good state.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<figure class=\"center\" id=\"id-6KGiJ\"><img alt=\"Alerting maturity hierarchy\" src=\"https://d3ansictanv2wj.cloudfront.net/Figure1-e274c0c6dd92bfb22a5f7e3cc263be88.png\"><figcaption><span class=\"label\">Figure 1. </span>Alerting maturity hierarchy. Source: Google.</figcaption></figure>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>While thinking about alerts in terms of cause-based versus symptom-based is somewhat orthogonal to this hierarchy, it may be useful to think of symptom-based alerts as falling under the reactive alerts category and cause-based alerts as falling under the proactive and investigative alerts categories.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h3>Types of alerts</h3>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>You can use the descriptions of alert types and example scenarios below to reason about corresponding sets of alerts for your service.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h4>Reactive alerts</h4>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Your business goals are <em>currently in immediate danger</em>. SLO-based alerting is a great example of reactive alerting.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><strong>Example scenario:</strong> Alert when you\\'re in danger of breaching an SLO. A good reactive alert fires when (to the best of our knowledge) there is an <em>imminent danger</em> of an SLO breach. This allows the human recipient to react to the danger before all is lost.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>If you haven\\'t set up reactive alerts for your service, it\\'s likely that most of your uptime-affecting incidents result from issues not captured in SLO alerts. After establishing a baseline of reactive alerts, your service should alert a human before the service exceeds its error budget. If an alert only fires when you have already violated your SLO, it\\'s too late to take action.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Note that “<em>to be in danger of</em>” does not mean the anticipated event will definitely happen. For example, the SLO burndown can recover on its own. It only means that with information available at the point of the alert, there’s a reasonable expectation the SLO will be violated if nobody takes action.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Of course, crafting a comprehensive set of reactive alerts is not straightforward. Not every situation that <em>could</em> endanger your SLO is worth alerting on.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h4>Proactive alerts</h4>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Your business goals are probably <em>going to be in danger soon but aren\\'t in immediate danger</em>—you\\'re on trend to hit problems. You aren’t burning error budget in a way that strongly indicates you’re in danger of breaching your SLO. Quota alerts are a good example of proactive alerts.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><strong>Example scenario:</strong> If you use a storage system that rejects write requests when you hit 100%, configure your alerting to warn you a week before you hit 100%, at which point you should proactively respond to the situation. For example, you could set up a garbage collection job to clear out extra quota usage. That way, your storage system never fills up completely and starts rejecting writes.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>In this scenario and similar ones, a reactive alert might complement your proactive alert. For example, if you\\'re in danger of hitting the 100% quota mark, the system would also trigger a reactive alert that your system is in danger of breaching its SLO.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h4>Investigative alerts</h4>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Your system is in some sort of unusual state, which may contribute to a partial failure now and/or a threat to a business goal later. For example, a server binary is restarting occasionally without a known cause, but no traffic is being affected because of redundancy or retries. Investigative alerts are particularly useful when the problem could be a sudden shift in user behavior. More often, investigative alerts indicate a service failure that is out of scope for any SLOs.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Examples:</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n\\t<li>Fluctuations in the number of users loading photos on a photo sharing app</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Sudden changes in usage patterns, such as a dramatic increase in 404 responses at the expense of all other response codes</li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><strong>Example scenario:</strong> Before developing investigative alerts, the system fails and sends an alert stating \"the compute jobs are crash-looping.\" After writing investigative alerts, the system more clearly states “the rate of 500 HTTP errors in the front end is growing dramatically and the jobs are crash-looping,” providing more footing to investigate the symptoms of the incident.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Recall that alerts necessarily involve human judgement and uncertainty. The alert fires because the system does not know what step to take next.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h3>How reactive, proactive, and investigative alerts work together</h3>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><strong>Think of these three alert types as a hierarchy.</strong> You should only move to higher levels of the pyramid if the foundations below are solid and not causing undue toil.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><strong>These alerts don’t need to be received by the same group of people.</strong> For example, in SRE-managed products, due to the reactive nature of oncall, it\\'s clear that SREs should care about reactive alerts when they directly correspond to business needs.

I will highlight the results of a recent survey on machine learning adoption, and along the way describe recent trends in data and machine learning (ML) within companies. This is a good time to assess enterprise activities, as there are many indications a number of companies are already beginning to use machine learning. For example, in a <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/data/free/state-of-machine-learning-adoption-in-the-enterprise.csp\">July 2018 survey</a> that drew more than 11,000 respondents, we found strong engagement among companies: 51% stated they already had machine learning models in production.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>With all the hype around AI, it can be tempting to jump into use cases involving data types with which you aren’t familiar. We found that companies that have successfully adopted machine learning do so either by building on existing data products and services, or by modernizing existing models and algorithms. Here are some typical ways organizations begin using machine learning:</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n\\t<li>Build upon existing analytics use cases: e.g., one can use existing data sources for business intelligence and analytics, and use them in an ML application.</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Modernize existing applications such as recommenders, search ranking, time series forecasting, etc.</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Use ML to unlock new data types—e.g., images, audio, video.</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Tackle completely new use cases and applications.</li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Consider deep learning, a specific form of machine learning that resurfaced in 2011/2012 due to record-setting models in speech and computer vision. While we continue to read about impressive breakthroughs in speech and computer vision, companies are beginning to use deep learning to augment or replace existing models and algorithms. A famous <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DynamicWebPaige/status/915326707107844097\">example</a> is Google’s machine translation system, which shifted from “stats focused” approaches to TensorFlow. In our own conferences, we see strong interest in training sessions and tutorials on deep learning for time series and natural language processing—two areas where organizations likely already have existing solutions, and for which deep learning is beginning to show some promise.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Machine learning is not only appearing in more products and systems, but as we noted in a <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/what-machine-learning-means-for-software-development\">previous post</a>, ML will also change how applications themselves get built in the future. Developers will find themselves increasingly building software that has ML elements. Thus, many developers will need to curate data, train models, and analyze the results of models. With that said, we are still in a highly empirical era for ML: we need big data, big models, and big compute.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<figure class=\"center\" id=\"id-6nGie\"><img alt=\"data pipeline for machine learning\" src=\"https://d3ansictanv2wj.cloudfront.net/Figure1-42c3aab5095af4d79c173569105ef320.png\"><figcaption><span class=\"label\">Figure 1. </span>A typical data pipeline for machine learning. Source: O\\'Reilly.</figcaption></figure>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>If anything, deep learning models are even more data hungry than previous algorithms favored by data scientists. Data is key to machine learning applications, and getting data flowing, cleaned, and in usable form is going to be key to sustaining a machine learning practice.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>With an eye toward the growing importance of machine learning, we recently completed <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/data/free/evolving-data-infrastructure.csp\">a data infrastructure survey</a> that drew more than 3,200 respondents. Our goal was twofold: (1) find out what tools and platforms people are using, and (2) determine whether or not companies are building the foundational tools needed to sustain their ML initiatives. Many respondents signaled that they were using open source tools (Apache Spark, Kafka, TensorFlow, PyTorch, etc.) and managed services in the cloud.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>One of the main questions we asked was: what are you currently building or evaluating?</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n\\t<li>Not surprisingly, data integration and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extract,_transform,_load\">ETL</a> were among the top responses, with 60% currently building or evaluating solutions in this area. In an age of data-hungry algorithms, everything really begins with collecting and aggregating data.</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>An important part of getting your data ready for machine learning is to normalize, standardize, and augment it with other data sources. 52% of survey respondents indicated they were building or evaluating solutions for data preparation and cleaning. These include human-in-the-loop systems for data preparation: these are tools that allow domain experts to train automated systems to do data preparation and cleaning at scale. In fact, there is an exciting new research area called <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/software-2-and-snorkel\">data programming</a>, which unifies techniques for the programmatic creation of training sets.</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>You also need solutions that let you understand what data you have and who can access it. About a third of the respondents in the survey indicated they are interested in data governance systems and data catalogs. Some companies are beginning to build their own solutions, and several will be presenting them at Strata Data in NYC this coming Fall—e.g., <a href=\"https://github.com/MarquezProject/marquez\">Marquez</a> (WeWork) and <a href=\"https://eng.uber.com/databook/\">Databook</a> (Uber). But this is also an area where startups—Alation, Immuta, Okera, and others—are beginning to develop interesting offerings.</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>21% of survey respondents said they are building or evaluating data lineage solutions. In the past, we got by with a casual attitude toward data sources. Discussions of data ethics, privacy, and security have made data scientists aware of the importance of data lineage and provenance. Specifically, companies will need to know where the data comes from, how it was gathered, and how it was modified along the way. The need to audit or reproduce ML pipelines is increasingly a legal and security issue. Fortunately, we are beginning to see open source projects (including <a href=\"https://github.com/iterative/dvc\">DVC</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/pachyderm\">Pachyderm</a>, <a href=\"https://delta.io/\">Delta Lake</a>, <a href=\"https://www.liquidata.co/#products\">DOLT</a>) that address the need for data lineage and provenance.

Thankfully, the research community has begun rolling out techniques and tools to address some of the important challenges ML presents, including fairness, explainability, safety and reliability, and especially security and privacy. Machine learning often interacts and impacts users, so companies not only need to put in place processes that will let them deploy ML responsibly, they need to build foundational technologies that will allow them to retain oversight, particularly when things go wrong. The technologies I’ve alluded to above—data governance, data lineage, model governance—are all going to be useful for helping manage these risks. In particular, auditing and testing machine learning systems will rely on many of the tools I’ve described above.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>There are real, not just theoretical, risks and considerations. These foundational tools will increasingly be essential and no longer optional. For example, a recent <a href=\"https://www.dlapiper.com/en/us/insights/publications/2019/01/gdpr-data-breach-survey/\">DLA Piper survey</a> provides an estimate of GDPR breaches that have been reported to regulators: more than 59,000 personal data breaches as of February, 2019.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<figure class=\"center\" id=\"id-34xiw\"><img alt=\"Machine learning involves a series of interrelated algorithms\" src=\"https://d3ansictanv2wj.cloudfront.net/Figure6-0ff46a11249e19d49a0344d303897fc3.png\"><figcaption><span class=\"label\">Figure 6. </span>Machine learning involves a series of interrelated algorithms. Source: O\\'Reilly.</figcaption></figure>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>While we tend to think of ML as producing a “model” or “algorithm” that we deploy, auditing ML systems can be challenging, as there are actually two algorithms to keep track of:</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n\\t<li>The actual model that one deploys and uses in an application of product</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Another algorithm (the “trainer” and “pipeline”) that uses data to produce the Model that best optimizes some objective function.</li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>So, managing ML really means building a set of tools that can manage a series of interrelated algorithms. Based on the survey results I’ve described above, companies are beginning to build the important foundational technologies—data integration and ETL, data governance and data catalogs, data lineage, model development and model governance—that are important to sustaining a responsible machine learning practice.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>But challenges remain, particularly as the use of ML grows within companies that are already having to grapple with many IT, software, and cloud solutions (besides having to manage the essential task of “keeping the lights on”).

I will highlight the results of a recent survey on machine learning adoption, and along the way describe recent trends in data and machine learning (ML) within companies. This is a good time to assess enterprise activities, as there are many indications a number of companies are already beginning to use machine learning. For example, in a <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/data/free/state-of-machine-learning-adoption-in-the-enterprise.csp\">July 2018 survey</a> that drew more than 11,000 respondents, we found strong engagement among companies: 51% stated they already had machine learning models in production.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>With all the hype around AI, it can be tempting to jump into use cases involving data types with which you aren’t familiar. We found that companies that have successfully adopted machine learning do so either by building on existing data products and services, or by modernizing existing models and algorithms. Here are some typical ways organizations begin using machine learning:</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n\\t<li>Build upon existing analytics use cases: e.g., one can use existing data sources for business intelligence and analytics, and use them in an ML application.</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Modernize existing applications such as recommenders, search ranking, time series forecasting, etc.</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Use ML to unlock new data types—e.g., images, audio, video.</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Tackle completely new use cases and applications.</li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Consider deep learning, a specific form of machine learning that resurfaced in 2011/2012 due to record-setting models in speech and computer vision. While we continue to read about impressive breakthroughs in speech and computer vision, companies are beginning to use deep learning to augment or replace existing models and algorithms. A famous <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DynamicWebPaige/status/915326707107844097\">example</a> is Google’s machine translation system, which shifted from “stats focused” approaches to TensorFlow. In our own conferences, we see strong interest in training sessions and tutorials on deep learning for time series and natural language processing—two areas where organizations likely already have existing solutions, and for which deep learning is beginning to show some promise.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Machine learning is not only appearing in more products and systems, but as we noted in a <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/what-machine-learning-means-for-software-development\">previous post</a>, ML will also change how applications themselves get built in the future. Developers will find themselves increasingly building software that has ML elements. Thus, many developers will need to curate data, train models, and analyze the results of models. With that said, we are still in a highly empirical era for ML: we need big data, big models, and big compute.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<figure class=\"center\" id=\"id-6nGie\"><img alt=\"data pipeline for machine learning\" src=\"https://d3ansictanv2wj.cloudfront.net/Figure1-42c3aab5095af4d79c173569105ef320.png\"><figcaption><span class=\"label\">Figure 1. </span>A typical data pipeline for machine learning. Source: O\\'Reilly.</figcaption></figure>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>If anything, deep learning models are even more data hungry than previous algorithms favored by data scientists. Data is key to machine learning applications, and getting data flowing, cleaned, and in usable form is going to be key to sustaining a machine learning practice.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>With an eye toward the growing importance of machine learning, we recently completed <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/data/free/evolving-data-infrastructure.csp\">a data infrastructure survey</a> that drew more than 3,200 respondents. Our goal was twofold: (1) find out what tools and platforms people are using, and (2) determine whether or not companies are building the foundational tools needed to sustain their ML initiatives. Many respondents signaled that they were using open source tools (Apache Spark, Kafka, TensorFlow, PyTorch, etc.) and managed services in the cloud.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>One of the main questions we asked was: what are you currently building or evaluating?</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n\\t<li>Not surprisingly, data integration and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extract,_transform,_load\">ETL</a> were among the top responses, with 60% currently building or evaluating solutions in this area. In an age of data-hungry algorithms, everything really begins with collecting and aggregating data.</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>An important part of getting your data ready for machine learning is to normalize, standardize, and augment it with other data sources. 52% of survey respondents indicated they were building or evaluating solutions for data preparation and cleaning. These include human-in-the-loop systems for data preparation: these are tools that allow domain experts to train automated systems to do data preparation and cleaning at scale. In fact, there is an exciting new research area called <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/software-2-and-snorkel\">data programming</a>, which unifies techniques for the programmatic creation of training sets.</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>You also need solutions that let you understand what data you have and who can access it. About a third of the respondents in the survey indicated they are interested in data governance systems and data catalogs. Some companies are beginning to build their own solutions, and several will be presenting them at Strata Data in NYC this coming Fall—e.g., <a href=\"https://github.com/MarquezProject/marquez\">Marquez</a> (WeWork) and <a href=\"https://eng.uber.com/databook/\">Databook</a> (Uber). But this is also an area where startups—Alation, Immuta, Okera, and others—are beginning to develop interesting offerings.</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>21% of survey respondents said they are building or evaluating data lineage solutions. In the past, we got by with a casual attitude toward data sources. Discussions of data ethics, privacy, and security have made data scientists aware of the importance of data lineage and provenance. Specifically, companies will need to know where the data comes from, how it was gathered, and how it was modified along the way.

These foundational tools will increasingly be essential and no longer optional. For example, a recent <a href=\"https://www.dlapiper.com/en/us/insights/publications/2019/01/gdpr-data-breach-survey/\">DLA Piper survey</a> provides an estimate of GDPR breaches that have been reported to regulators: more than 59,000 personal data breaches as of February, 2019.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<figure class=\"center\" id=\"id-34xiw\"><img alt=\"Machine learning involves a series of interrelated algorithms\" src=\"https://d3ansictanv2wj.cloudfront.net/Figure6-0ff46a11249e19d49a0344d303897fc3.png\"><figcaption><span class=\"label\">Figure 6. </span>Machine learning involves a series of interrelated algorithms. Source: O\\'Reilly.</figcaption></figure>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>While we tend to think of ML as producing a “model” or “algorithm” that we deploy, auditing ML systems can be challenging, as there are actually two algorithms to keep track of:</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n\\t<li>The actual model that one deploys and uses in an application of product</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Another algorithm (the “trainer” and “pipeline”) that uses data to produce the Model that best optimizes some objective function.</li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>So, managing ML really means building a set of tools that can manage a series of interrelated algorithms. Based on the survey results I’ve described above, companies are beginning to build the important foundational technologies—data integration and ETL, data governance and data catalogs, data lineage, model development and model governance—that are important to sustaining a responsible machine learning practice.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>But challenges remain, particularly as the use of ML grows within companies that are already having to grapple with many IT, software, and cloud solutions (besides having to manage the essential task of “keeping the lights on”). The good news is that there are early indicators that companies are beginning to acknowledge the need to build or acquire the requisite foundational technologies.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><strong>Related resource:</strong></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n\\t<li><a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/sustaining-machine-learning-in-the-enterprise\">“Sustaining machine learning in the enterprise”</a></li>\\r\\n\\t<li><a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/specialized-tools-for-machine-learning-development-and-model-governance-are-becoming-essential\">“Specialized tools for machine learning development and model governance are becoming essential”</a></li>\\r\\n\\t<li><a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/managing-risk-in-machine-learning\">“Managing risk in machine learning”</a></li>\\r\\n\\t<li>\\r\\n<a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/what-are-machine-learning-engineers\">“What are machine learning engineers?”</a>: a new role focused on creating data products and making data science work in production</li>\\r\\n\\t<li><a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/what-machine-learning-means-for-software-development\">“What machine learning means for software development”</a></li>\\r\\n\\t<li><a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/deep-automation-in-machine-learning\">“Deep automation in machine learning”</a></li>\\r\\n\\t<li>\\r\\n<a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/what-is-hardcore-data-science-in-practice\">“What is hardcore data science—in practice?”</a>: the anatomy of an architecture to bring data science into production</li>\\r\\n\\t<li><a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/lessons-learned-turning-machine-learning-models-into-real-products-and-services\">“Lessons learned turning machine learning models into real products and services”</a></li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n<p>Continue reading <a href=\\'https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/becoming-a-machine-learning-company-means-investing-in-foundational-technologies\\'>Becoming a machine learning company means investing in foundational technologies.</a></p><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/oreilly/radar/atom/~4/TV_rXYivxwE\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>',\n",
