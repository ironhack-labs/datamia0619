,Title,Body
0,Would not open for me to read,Never could open it total wastbog time
1,Doesn't come with membership!,"Not what comes with membership as advertised, and from all other reviews not worth it!"
2,Not the magazine of yesteryear,"No longer the magazine was back years ago. Complete issues about certain topics. To fill in magazine, there's the same topic written differently in 3-4 months mags. Not current,there's articles from 3 yrs.ago just being published now.<br/>Don't waste your time renewing a gift subscription,  the vendor won't sent to the person to be gifted, instead to the person whom paid the subscription.  And wont change when contacted. Just get a new subscription in a different name,same address."
3,Old issues?,I bought these for my dad. When he got them he told me he's already read all of the stories online.  Super disappointed.
4,Hard to enjoy reading,Great magazine . Hard to enjoy reading
5,Not a good format for the tablet,"Unless you have really good vision, it will be difficult to read the text. It is more effort than it is worth to me. I tried to cancel my subscription after the first year, but they charged my CC anyway.<br/>I would avoid this."
6,"Great Magazine, took forever to get here","I love Nat Geo and their content, and I was excited to receive my first copy, but it took about 6 months for me to see a magazine in my mailbox."
7,I paid for prescriptions so l expected to receive what l paid for,"Only received 2 issues , where‚Äôs the one for this year"
8,"Missed issue, redundant topics","I kinda felt ripped off on the issues dedicated to one topic. The 1st I received was about new/future medicine. I have no interest in that, so the whole issue was wasted. Shortly after, one was all about 'cities'. Luckily, that was interesting to me or it would've been 2 in 3 or 4.<br/>Furthermore, I hadn't received an issue. It's been 2-plus weeks, and near the end of the month; only been told they will send my concerns to the proper department. I've tried contact them 3 times and just got the same auto-answer"
9,Not availabel for PCs,Most magazines are not available for PC
10,RECEIVED ONLY TWO(2) issues,"I received TWO magazines!!! :) And then big fat nothing till the subscription expired in march. Interestingly, I ve tried to post a review with the above facts  - and somehow, mysteriously, it never goes through....?????????"
11,Only received 4 if 12 issues due,"Beautiful, informative magazine.  I paid for 12 issues, only received 4"
12,Don't waste your money,Useless; better picks from a garbage can.. What idiots picked these to sell? Kindly show them the path to a cliff..
13,Not the NatGeo Magazine I remember,After receiving 6 or so issues I have come to the conclusion that the NatGeo staff has run out of ideas with regard to  including anything of remote interest to me in their magazine. The pictures are still nice if you enjoy some jerk free climbing a sheer rock face or an entire issue on cities. As a result every issue so far has been thrown away. Something that in the past would have been considered a sacrilege.  I won't re-subscribe nor recommend it to family and friends.
14,Kindle  can't do justice to National Geographic,"National Geographic is as much about the pictures as the text, therefore Kindle is not a good medium for it."
15,Was a gift,Cant' go wrong with National Geographic!
16,Strongly dislike,How the mighty have fallen! No resemblance to the former Geographic before Fox degradation. A publishing disgrace.
17,Can not see back issues,Does back issues can be seen later?
18,"They only stay for a month? Unable to keep digital magazines purchased, anywhere on device!","I ordered this digital magazine, and just because I couldn‚Äôt read it right away in its entirety prior to future additions, they‚Äôre gone! I can‚Äôt find them anywhere! Not in my library or anywhere! What a scam. So disappointed, never finished first one received and already the fourth one is here and I‚Äôm without reading all prior ones!"
19,Scam,"I had a year's subscription and only received a few at best, def. not even close to 12. This might be a scam"
20,Noise vs Knowledge,Why is National Geographic Aerial America music louder volume than the spoken dialog?
21,Change of Direction,"I subscribed to Nat Geo for more than 30 years. I thoroughly enjoyed the content of each issue. Then subject matter changed from people, science and geography to socially relevant material. A whole issue devoted to Transgender was the tipping point.....that magazine went straight to the recycle bin and I ended my subscription."
22,Never got it...,I only received one magazine from this subscription. Only one. The whole year I only got one magazine! üò† and now it saying my subscription is expiring...
23,Check National Geo website for price first,Three stars:<br/>5 stars for the magazine<br/>1 star for Amazon<br/><br/>Please check national graphic‚Äôs website for better deals than amazons ‚Äúlimited time left‚Äù options.
24,Over priced,I like the magazine but the price is high if you go directly to natgeo it's a lot cheaper
25,Ok,It‚Äôs good but charged me twice so I was gonna givethe as a gift but only one order showed u
26,ELECTRONIC VERSION NOT SUPPORTED BY AMAZON!,"THERE IS NO POINT IN SPENDING GOOD MONEY ON ELECTRONIC VERSION OF THIS MAGAZINE!!! Amazon used to support it, but doesn't anymore. Don't be tricked into buying it."
27,Just too expensive,"Fairly interesting, but of course it is no longer the magazine I grew up with, but neither is the world.  Frankly, it is just too expensive and I can find indepth articles at the source ( papers written by explorers or scientists) on line with a little bit of work."
28,Terrible international subscription customer service,"No doubt a great product, but customer service abysmal. Tried to give a gift subscription from US to UK. Impossible on website. On hold and misdirected for over an hour before being given a number to call in the UK. Quite extraordinary and antediluvian."
29,I won't order this again!,"I got this for my mother who always loved the magazine. But...it took over three months to get the first issue! And it is a lot smaller than ever, thin and a great disappointment. This is a subscription which is cheaper than buying in the store but not worth it."
30,Digital version a useless joke,"Having subscribed to this magazine a few years ago, I decided to try a digital version.  I assumed that since I can read my purchased books in the Kindle cloud reader, I would also be able to read purchased magazines.  WRONG!  I must have missed that this is NOT AVAILABLE for reading on the cloud reader.  Not having a Kindle device or a tablet, my only other option is trying to read on my phones.  A HORRIBLE READING EXPERIENCE FOR THIS MAGAZINE!  NO MORE MAGAZINES for me until Amazon fixes this major defect."
31,Shady deal!,"I've always enjoyed Nat. Geo. magazine and have subscribed for many years. I just re-subscribed in September 2018, and on Nov.9,received the Sept,Oct and Nov issues all on the same day. Not sure if this is Amazon or Nat. Geo.but I think it's lousy to send back issues as part of my 12 issue subscription.Won't be renewing at the end of this year,whenever that is."
32,"Good magazine, higher cost than necessary",Trying for a second time to review and let people know that while this is a great magazine it is s.ix doll.ars more here than at the vendors page.
33,Would take 8 weeks for 1st magazine,Cancelled order
34,Three Stars,Small type
35,Not much geography,"I've subscribed to the National Geographic magazine for over 40 years.  This is not the same magazine that was published in 20th century.  This century the magazine is largely focused on science and environmental issues, and geography is a minor subject.  They do a descent job on the these topics, but I miss the old articles focusing on the geography of areas of the United States, and I miss learning of the geography around the world.  I'd recommend joining the Sierra Club, National Wildlife, or your local environmental organization for better environment articles.  Scientific American might be a better choice for science articles."
36,Good but slow availability on digital vs print,"Reading it on the kindle app for iPad is the best way to experience this version, specially on the iPad Pro 12.9 screen. My only problem is the delay on which the magazine is available to download vs physical copy availability. Felt awkward seeing the July edition print version at a physical news stand, but took days to be available in my kindle subscription, when it should be the other way around. I started noticing this pattern across other publications and newspapers that Im trying out via Kindle system. It seems that paying customer via Amazon Kindle system are not treated equal vs the magazine or newspaper digital direct subscribers. Sure, you might save some money via the Kindle system, but at a cost."
37,Not a deal,Don't think it is a deal.. because National Geographic  itself selling in $19 for a year.. how can they show $71 and deal on that price..
38,One Star,Did not receive all subscriptio
39,Make sure you receive you're full subscription!,"Poor customer service from NG.  I used Amazon to renew my present subscription.  When I received my first issue, I also received 2 older issues.  These older issues of NG were ones I already had.  It turns out I'm then only receiving a 10 month subscription to the magazine.  When I inquired with customer service at NG, they blew me off and deferred me to Amazon.  They should have taken care of it ASAP."
40,One Star,Cannot cancel it easily
41,Leans to the left...,Ok I guess. A little too liberal for my liking...
42,One Star,I only received 2 out of 12 times.<br/>This is a complete scam.
43,Not what it use to be.,This is the second time I have given nat geo a try and I am very very disappointed. The articles have gone down the tubes they lean heavily politically and have lost a lot of the scientific unbiased view I Expect From such A Storied publication. It Is a Real Shame . . They should take a session from there sister publication may geo history which is a much better magazine.
44,One Star,I just got 6 issues and then stopped getting them
45,Waste of Time,"Low on the ""Geographic"" high on the ""People Magazine"" . Interview with Paul McCartney...really."
46,Personally I like to see more about endangered species,This magazine never disappoints.  Personally I like to see more about endangered species.  This problem must be stopped.
47,Buggy delivery,"Every time a new issue comes out to your kindle, you'll encounter a bug, such as your last magazine issue being completely gone and instead it'll show two issues of the latest magazine. Terrible"
48,"It's a great magazine, however","It's a great magazine, however, I purchased the subscription in November and at the end of December I got three issues on the same date.  I wanted a year's subscription, not one late magazine (Novembers) and then Dec and Jan as well.  I expected one per month to last a year, not a quarter year's worth all delivered at the same time.  I don't have the time to read three issues a month, especially during the holiday season when much is going on."
49,Three Stars,"Update,  my issue of June the contents disappear when the July was uploaded. I didn't finished read the  June magazine. Now I have two July.. That's second time that happened . I don't know if the problem is from National Geographic or Kindle, but  I give up , no more renews ."
50,I feel like it‚Äôs really only a 9 month subscription,"Got my husband a 1year subscription for Christmas since he loves this magazine. The subscription was supposed to start January 1st, but when it arrived, October, November, December issues came. I feel like it‚Äôs really only a 9 month subscription."
51,Not receiving,Have not received any issues since purchase.
52,One Star,I didnt subscribe to national geographic!
53,Nothing more than a magazine full of useless advertising now. Not even close to the magazine we had as kids.,"Nothing but advertising now. Why should people pay for a magazine full of useless ads that the advertisers already paid you for? My grandmother had issues from the early 1900's forward, I enjoyed them for years. Step forward and I order them for my kids based on that memory. Oh boy, what a letdown that was. Good luck finding any content in the midst of an ad book. When the issue with the sodomite showed up that was it, I cancelled. I had originally just intended to let it run the year out its last issue in November. Step forward to today and they are now trying to bill me $39 for a renewal to this worthless book of ads. I guess they have degraded in far more ways than one."
54,Wish they would send one at a time.,"Good articles, but waited a long time. Then received three issues all at once. Would prefer they were spaced out."
55,One Star,Owned by Fox and is now filled with a ton of ads.
56,One Star,NG has become politically liberal junk.
57,One Star,I was deceived with the subscription as I received only one copy initially and didn't receive the second one or later on.I have provided one star as I received one copy.
58,Old issues,"I don't have any problem with the magazine itself. The cheat is sending me two back issues as part of my year subscription. Puts that ""reduced"" price in a different perspective. Shame on you, National Geographic!"
59,I like it when they keep it scientific and professional,"Entertaining magazine as usual.  I like it when they keep it scientific and professional.  However, since last year they have been a bit bias against our POTUS!  I don't read a science magazine to read about leftist viewpoints.  Keep it professional."
60,Paid in July 2017 and still waiting for delivery as of Dec 2017,"I would STRONGLY encourage anyone seek to subscribe to this failing serial to manage the subscription through Amazon and not deal directly with the National Geographic Partners LLC.  Despite the articles becaming more liberal, polarizing, and less about science and more about social issues, we faithfully renewed our subscription that we've had for over 16 years,  And we waited for the August 2017 issue, then for September 2017, and October 2017, and November 2017, and now December 2017.  Still with nothing.<br/>I guess the National Geographic could sense they were going to lose me as a subscriber after this year and decided to end the relationship only after robbing me of $19.<br/>If you feel the need to read this rag, borrow a copy from the library instead of buying a subscription."
61,Not for kids,Not the same magazine you grew up with. Not appropriate in content for children. I cancelled after the first issue arrived
62,One Star,I ever received it it was my hubby‚Äôs birthday present. Thanks a whole lot.
63,Misleading name,"The content is definitely international. And it covers more than geographic topics. Delves into more cultural aspects. Really should consider renaming it international culture publication, ICP for short."
64,A bit behind...,I ordered 5 months ago and have yet to receive one issue....
65,Just not the same! When I was a kid ...,"Just not the same!<br/><br/>When I was a kid, National Geographic was the go-to to look at pictures of topless women when you couldn‚Äôt find ‚Äúwoods porn‚Äù behind the 7-Eleven.  This led to my fetish with Ubangi tribes women.  Nary a topless tribes woman to be found anymore.<br/><br/>Also, this is much smaller and thinner than it used to be.  It was common for us to have stacks of old National Geographic magazines in the basement that we would use for kindling, impromptu body armor, or just rolling them up and using them as a blunt weapon.<br/><br/>Price has gone up and quality has gone down.  And don‚Äôt get me started on ‚ÄúTV Guide!‚Äù"
66,Three Stars,Not a great situation with the Kindle
67,Disappointed,"I was enjoying the articles until I came across the piece on ocean conservation. I was highly disappointed that it advocated ""petting"" gray whales which is violating the marine mammal protection act."
68,Very disappointed with item and customer service,"I purchased this mag in May of this year, in  July, I received this magazine, with a total of three issues arriving on the same day including 2 older magazines.  I have received no magazines since.  I was on hold with a supervisor for 53 minutes to rectify this problem.  While waiting, I went on line to National Geographic's official site and found out that I can get this deal for the same price and it includes digital access as well for no extra charge. I was then hung up on and am now waiting again to speak with a supervisor.  I am very disappointed with Amazon's customer service"
69,Somebody must be enjoying a good magazine.,Have ordered this magazine 2 years in a row and have not received even one issue. I will not waste my money a third time.
70,Im pretty bummed about that,Apparently it takes 2 months to start getting the magazine. Im pretty bummed about that.
71,"Great mag, crappy Kindle.","The magazine itself is, of course, excellent. But trying to read it on a Kindle Fire really sucks!"
72,It has been hijacked by propagandists.,I used to love this publication.  I have been subscribing to it for 48 years.  I am canceling my subscription this year.  It has turned into political propaganda for liberals.
73,One Star,Not getting regularly...
74,National Geographic used to be a serious scientific vehicle. ...,"National Geographic used to be a serious scientific vehicle. Now, it is a political tool, used by the editors to advance their agenda. I have canceled my subscription because they feature ""transgender"" instead of simply national cultural interests. They are also more concerned with pushing the dingy environmental lobby's agenda than they are at getting to scientific, provable facts. The left has taken over the magazine, and are advancing leftist notions, using conservatives' money! Shame on them!"
75,Gone Downhill for Years,This magazine was a go to as a pleasurable read for decades but has now turned into a social and political commentary.  No longer is there science and history articles that are enjoyable to read.  Now it is politics and opinions.  If you do not agree with these politics you are automatically a bad person.  Cancelling my subscription after several decades.
76,Three Stars,"Initial offer great, then auto renew at twice the price, I cancelled the renewal."
77,One Star,Save your money and go on the National Geographic site and get the same 12 months for $12.00.
78,I have enjoyed the magazine in the past,Maybe it was the subject matter.Just not interesting to me.I have enjoyed the magazine in the past.
79,Geographical disappointment,Not what they used to be....
80,One Star,"Didn't order I don't think,as well as the popular science."
81,Not your daddy's National Geographic.,I cancelled my subscription after 2 issues. It appears that the publication's basis n science has morphed to sociology and political correctness. Not the same publication it was 20 years ago :(
82,National Geographic use to be a highly regarded magazine. ...,"National Geographic use to be a highly regarded magazine.  Before I could afford to buy it, I would read it at my local library.  No more.  It goes immediately into my trash and I will never subscribe to it or read it again."
83,Nothing says nature and geography like a 12 yr old boy all tarted up as ...,Nothing says nature and geography like a 12 yr old boy all tarted up as a girl on the cover. Decades of publication and that's the cover they choose to advertise with on Amazon. These SJWs are frigging relentless.
84,Cheaper to buy off National Geographics Website,I saw this deal and went to the national geographis website and the actual value is $15/year for the hard copy and digital copy. Don't be deceived. If you just want the digital copy it's only $12/year...
85,Save your money.,Not at all the quality it was in the past.  Articles are not as well written and seem biased.  I want facts not opinions!
86,Not what it used to be,"This magazine used to be about creatures of the deep oceans and rain forests.  Now it is about 10 year old girls wanting to be boys and vice versa.  It is no longer about the wonders of the world, it has become very political and nothing more than a headline grabber.  Don't waste your money - very little content inside."
87,Godless Perverrt Slop Now,A recently converted worthless bumholer little rag.  Even lousy fish wrapper paper.
88,Nat Geo is now garbage.,This once great magazine has devolved into a shill for the far left propaganda machine. I will never have this garbage in my home again.
89,Not Just Science and Geography Any More,I have all the issues since 1961 through 2014.  My Grandparents kept them from the year I was born and then I started subscribing in my 20's.  I cancelled my subscription permanently and will never give them another cent.  They have started injecting one sided political views into what was once one of my most enjoyable reads.  Too Bad. The days of scientific and geographical curiosity and honesty seem to have slipped into the past.
90,Anything for money!,"Sick of seeing this ""Gender Revolution"" promo picture. Frustrated with Amazon showing it over and over and over on the ""deals"" page. What people will do, and exploit, for a buck."
91,One Star,USED TO BE a good magazine
92,Gender is NOT a social construct.,Gender is NOT a social construct. This has turned into a liberal rag
93,Nonsense,This magazine has become nonsense.
94,One Star,I'm tired of seeing the Gender Revolution cover too.
95,Used to be great but...,Very sad shadow of what NG used to be. Far less content and half of it seems to be paid advertisements disguised as an article.
96,Garbage. Another great institution lost to the taudry elite,Garbage.<br/>Another great institution lost to the taudry elite.
97,Creepy,"This used to be a great magazine. Now it's a gender bending, value destroying, soul sucking piece of garbage. No thanks."
98,Three Stars,Seems like they're less pages than they used to be....
99,Print is too small to read,Print is too small to read. I have already removed it from my Fire.<br/><br/>National Geographic should make electronic versions of their magazines that can be read in a browser online or be downloaded (.pdf) and read on any device. Other organizations have done this.
100,Not kindle friendly,"Magazine great, kindle version not great."
101,I was very disappointed that NG felt the need,No need to weigh in on transgender. I was very disappointed that NG felt the need. Will not renew.
102,Another formerly great magazine ruined by the Progressive Cult,National Geographic thinks it's a good idea for Progressive Parents to turn their children into transgenders.
103,WARNING - Be sure you are getting what you expect.,Not the NG I grew up with. SUPER LIBERAL POLITICAL AGENDA written mostly by women. Mine goes right in the trash. Will not renew when it expires. Very disappointing.
104,I love the research that the National Geographic Foundation sponsors,"I love the research that the National Geographic Foundation sponsors, its documentation of our world, and the beautiful publication that it produces. However I was extremely displeased with the amount of junk mail this subscription generated, very wasteful. I would rather pay more to get these at the store without all the wasted paper in my mail box."
105,"One more thing I couldn't throw away, but never did get around to reading them","Thought I would read this more than I did. It ended up being one of those things I told myself I would get around to reading and so I wouldn't throw them away, and before I knew it, almost the entire year subscription was on a shelf collecting dust."
106,Also the poor boy on the cover is being infantilized,"In this months issue 9 year olds are hailed as being 'wise' circumcision is considered horrific and a seventeen year old girl having her breasts removed to help.her become male is considered a societal advance. Very strange. Have had this magazine for,awhile now and it is biased. Check out Crime DNA issue. Very biased. Weak journalism. Also the poor boy on the cover is being infantilized. He needs Willy Wonka now!"
107,Would not download.,Wouldn't download into my KindlePC or my Kindle on my phone.
108,Used to be a great magazine. The cover story indicates it's going down ...,Used to be a great magazine.  The cover story  indicates it's going down hill.
109,I am disappointed with the liberalism that is engrained in every issue,"I remember reading this publication when I was younger and being pulled in time and time again. I am disappointed with the liberalism that is engrained in every issue. I just wish it was more unbiased reading for my family. There is enough of that stuff in the main stream media as it is, not you too National Geographic :("
110,The transgender article is the beginning of the end of this once-great magazine,"Absolutely kooky, political stuff here. I've noticed the magazine has been turning into Vice lately, and it's lame. There definitely is a concerted effort to force appeal to the most radical of millennials, hipster types, so on and so forth. I'm done. This used to be a great magazine. It's sad to say that I don't even want to look at it anymore."
111,One Star,Magazine has gone off the rails.
112,NG not what it use to be.,"National Geographic used to be a great magazine, they now have a staff that is all about pushing left wing politics.  I love nature and I love interesting stories but I don't need to be preached to in a mag I pay for."
113,National Geographic lets me travel where I cannot go.,I enjoyed the subscription for the most part.
114,Biosed,Bad artical about Gender almost through up three times reading it this magazine has gone way down hill give me a break what a joke it has become want my money back
115,NG,JUST SCAN.  DON'T REALLY READ IT.
116,Lost its way.,"Where have you gone?  I have been a faithful subscriber to NG for many,many years  but no longer. It seems the articles are anything but national or geographic. The ""transgender"" article was a new low and my tipping point. I cancelled my subscription straight away. Wise for them to go back to the orginial mission statement."
117,A fallen publication.,"Once upon a time, there was an amazing magazine that brought the world to our homes, with insightful and informative reports about the environment and people around the world. Then, one day, it was bought by powerful media men and everyone on staff was fired. The new owner hired his own writers, ones that could use the good reputation that had been built over the years of truth and beauty to their advantage. They began to corrupt the magazine with their perspective, editing the vision in the same way that they had used a news station to steer people's opinion and stifle free though. In that way, they enslaved the minds of the people with lies."
118,Its been 3 months and have not received it,It's been 3 months and I still have not received any issues.
119,It's not like the magazine not worth buying,It's not  like the magazine  not  worth  buying
120,"OK magazine, bad customer service","I've always enjoyed National Geographic in its print format. The digital version is OK, but it's not interactive in any way.  When I activated my digital account, I was suppose to be able to download all of my previous issues. Several of  my recent issues weren't available. When I asked customer service for help, they treated me like I was incompetent and failed to solve the problem. I was so insulted by the way they treated me that I canceled my subscription. I had subscribed for 3 years."
121,Three Stars,TARDA MUCHO EN DESCARGARSE LA REVISTA
122,Very disappointed.,I had all the digital magazines since it was first offered on Kindle. I need to upgrade my kindle and was told by Amazon and NGM that there was no way to back up and retrieve these magazines that I paid for. Basically NGM stole my past issues. Very disappointed.
123,The issue don't meet my Kindle Fire HDX,"The issue s from 2016 April just become a PDf or Jpeg form .That's not my thought for a older Kindle Fire HDX user. So I quit my subscription at 08/01 but they already charged my next year's subscription. I dont know how can I get my momey back. And I quit my subscription at 0801 the August issue doesnt come in my HDX, that make me have to verified my subscription at 08/23 to download my last issue then I quit it again. That's so suck !!! And no sense for me .Very noneresonable for this."
124,Better to pick them up for free at garage sales,Thanks for the reviews.  Saved headaches.  The periodical in decline and failures of seller-intermediary.  Better to pick them up for free at garage sale
125,Don't forget to check the source - it may be cheaper.,It's less expensive if you order directly from Nat Geo.. 15 for 12 print issues.
126,One Star,"I loved this magazine 20 years ago, but it is junk now.  No science left in the pages."
127,One Star,Too small
128,One Star,Changed my address and it STILL went to the old address. Furious for my $19 going down the drain.
129,Poor subscription service,"I ordered this for my granddaughter and three months after she began receiving this, they moved.  My daughter-in-law notified them before they moved of the new address but four months later she finally received one.  Very disappointed in the time it took to update the records as now she has missed several issues and my gift was not as valuable.  Other than that, my granddaughter loves the magazine."
130,Fox news agenda,"This magazine is now owned by Rupert Murdoch. If you like your information like you like fox news ""fair and balanced"" do not purchase this subscription."
131,DO NOT SUPPORT RUPERT MURDOCK,"This magazine was bought out by Rupert Murdock recently.  This is now another medium for Faux news.<br/><br/>Do not expect quality articles on nature and science anymore... They have been replaced by religious ads, religious theories and other nonsensical articles."
132,Can't access the publication after paying twice,"I received an email advertising a subscription for $5, so I took the bait.  Then I was unable to access the publication.  I emailed and asked for instructions, which included clicking on a ""purchase"" button where I would supposedly be given the option to enter my subscription.  Well, I wound up accidentally purchasing another, not discounted, subscription in that manner.  When I wrote back they never addressed this issue.  Now I've paid five times the original price I expected to pay, and guess what?  I STILL can't access the publication on my Kindle Fire!"
133,One Star,"NatGeo used to be one of the best magazines ever, but lately content is not very scientific."
134,The mighty has fallen :(,"Sad sad day that such a powerful and reputable magazine, that fed such amazing information on the World to generations is now garbage and nothing but a name to a Billionaire for his own Mecia agenda... I cancelled my subscription last year. The amount of junk it came w not too mention the scam callwasjust too much."
135,Not the old Nat Geo,Not Great by any means. But still has some good info and articles.
136,One Star,My kindle fire is no longer supported by NG!!!
137,I'd recommend avoiding the middleman,"You can order it directly from National Geographic for $15, but that is just the magazine not the online stuff.<br/>I'd recommend avoiding the middleman."
138,Two Stars,"Odd mixture of smugness, preachiness, and depression."
139,Peak Oil and Seal Levels FAIL,"I used to love Nat Geo magazine.<br/><br/>But after their ""Peak Oil"" expose I realized that they took too big of a bite of the Al Gore apple.<br/><br/>Peak oil? Are you serious? They pegged 2006 as the high point of oil production.<br/><br/>They also made some crazy predictions on sea levels.<br/><br/>Neither one has come to pass."
140,"I consider anything with the name ""National Geographic"" not worth ...","I consider anything with the name ""National Geographic"" not worth my time or money.  By carrying and defending Cesar Millan, National Geogrphic has proven that they are only out for ratings and sales.  They care nothing about the science of  behavior.  How can anybody take this publication seriously.  Such a joke.  I have to wonder, how much research do they really do?"
141,Emagazine,Nothing spectacular.
142,Do not buy... I received 1 magazine ...,Do not buy ...I received 1 magazine and never received another one.....
143,Please provide facts not re-enforce agendas,"I grew up reading NG in the 60's.  Great source of info, and at that time, pictures for school projects.<br/><br/>After several decades I tried a year subscribtion.<br/>.<br/>The last article I read was Lincoln's Funeral Train.  Started off interesting then quickly developed into a political discourse on race.  What I was looking for was an article that was written with insight from historians and not an article that was written to express a person's political agenda.<br/><br/>There are plenty of sites where people can go to get opinions.  NG should not be on of them.  It should set out facts through appropriate interviews, pictures, diagrams, and allow the reader to make up their own mind and, more importantly, investigate further."
144,The magazine is entertaining and great. I would renew the membership if it weren't ...,The magazine is entertaining and great. I would renew the membership if it weren't for amazon's policies with the subscription.
145,Shady advertising claims on digital subscription,"No application for this magazine in the US. Called customer service to find out what is going on. The magazine advertisement says download a kindle or iPad app for magazines, but customer service told me that you have to access them while you're online, which means no editions can be downloaded to your device to read while you're offline - you have to go through the process of logging on to their website every time you want to open the magazine to read an article . Cancelled my subscription."
146,Fox Ruined National Geographic; It is now Garbage,"It pains me to give National Geographic a poor review. However, it is no longer the magazine that it once was. Fox Media recently purchased this magazine in order to spread misinformation as they have done through outlets like Fox News. They instituted the largest layoff and firing in the magazine's history.They are using its reputation in order to mislead its readers. I have been a subscriber for years. It makes me sick to see this source of information and inspiration go in the toilet."
147,Wanted to buy but not after reading the reviews..,"I want old real National Geographic back, please.. Don't change a magazine and it's place in human history.. If you want to, then start another magazine with new ideas, rather than changing the contents of a well established magazine and change it to something else."
148,Sorry Rupert,"Used to be a member in the glory days. Now that Rupert Murdoch bought the magazine, I will never look at the magazine, website or TV programs again."
149,REVISED (Great magazine but order it from the NatGeo website instead),"For $19, I ordered this directly from the publisher, AND I get the Kindle edition included. Great buy<br/><br/>4.15.16 There IS no Kindle edition for this magazine. In order to read the electronic version, you must log on to their website. Totally worthless in this regard and false advertising."
150,No Longer Trust National Geographic,"I will no longer purchase Nat Geo magazines, nor watch the channel on TV.  Rupert Murdoch's recent takeover is already beginning to influence the content and has subsequently diluted the Nat Geo name as a trusted source.  Unfortunate.  Sad."
151,Rupert murdocks bitch.,Absolute garbage from the mouth of fox news.
152,Three Stars,Great magazine until I was completely turned off by a biased unscientific opinion article claiming to be scientific.
153,One Star,Global warming has always been a fraud!!!!
154,One Star,Fox News with nice photos? No thanks.  Murdoch ruins everything he touches.
155,Soiled Truth,Not worth it now that  Flat Earther Murdock bought it.
156,Three Stars,A new insight in human evolutio
157,No available app for the Kindle Fire,"Something is seriously wrong and misleading with this publication. I ordered the digital edition directly from the National Geographic Website. Their site lists the ""Kindle Fire"" as one of the devices this is available on. However, there is no Nat Geo app available in the Amazon store to download. It was removed I am told so the only way that I can access this is to go to the Web site and open one article and cannot download the publication. Their Web site showed this as available almost a year ago and I have no app to use still. Their web site has still not been corrected. They happily take your money with no inclination to provide the product as advertised."
158,Three Stars,Problem getting it started.
159,One Star,The subscription was not consistent didn't receive all the magazines that I should have
160,It is sad to see what used to be a respected publication ...,National Geographic has lost its gloss for us.  Too many issues subject the reader to yet another preachy article based on dodgy 'science' about global warming or social issues that should not be the purlieu of this publication.  We will probably not renew our subscription when the next opportunity arises.  It is sad to see what used to be a respected publication become yet another propaganda medium.
161,One Star,Orderd Father's Day and still won't have Fourth of July boooooooooooo!booooooooooo
162,"National Geographic is changing, and not for the better","When I was a teenager, I looked forward to this magazine. I have been a subscriber for years. Why only 3 stars? This last year or so, articles have been strange. They aren't about some quaint European village or isolated tribe or park, etc. as they were in the past. It's getting pc, and not just with global warming or climate change or whatever they call it this month. Something like ""geography of the brain"" had some interesting points but it would have been more appropriate for another type of publication. I don't know if I'll renew my subscription."
163,Lacks indepth information,"The articals lacks in depth information, to be better, it should referance other"
164,Three Stars,Not same quality in recent years in my opinion; regular subscriber since 1971.
165,I just got a surface tablet to replace my android ...,"I just got a surface tablet to replace my android tablet, only to discover that NG isn't available on kindle for windows. So I've basically lost access to all of the back issues I've already paid for."
166,"Love National Geographic, but app unimpressive","I love the magazine, but this digital version did not load properly onto my kindle fire. Some articles downloaded quickly while others have yet to show up . (download process is going on 3 weeks now). I will stick with the physical version of the magazine."
167,NG leaves kindle users in the dark with new app,"Used to be able to access archives on old app,no longer on new one. If you go to website to access you must have flash to access = kindle SD users out of luck.They sold my subscription based on access to archives,now the just take it away."
168,Not what it used to be.,I used to subscribe to NatGeo for its tasteful nudes. One can never have too much alternative spank material. But lately these pictures have been lacking. C'mon NatGeo - we need more naked aborigines and less insightful content.
169,"I am VERY disappointed in the ""new and improved"" National Geographic Amazon Kindle ...","I am VERY disappointed in the ""new and improved"" National Geographic Amazon Kindle application.  I previously had the ability to store and review all issues from my paid digital subscription - now all I can see is the latest edition.  I'm switching to my new iPad Air.  Sorry Kindle"
170,Three Stars,Okay magazine for what it is.
171,You cant' use National Geographic App anymore.,I was getting the print copy and Kindle copy from National Geographic Soc. for a year. My last kindle copy was FEB 2015.  Amazon does not support the National Geographic app anymore. But I find it funny that they have a National Geographic Turkey apps. This is the USA. I was force to cancel my subscription with National Geographic Soc. and get it the kindle copy from Amazon. Amazon does not offer the print and digital combine. Thanks a lot Amazon this is the first  complaint I have against you. The one star is for Amazon not the mag.
172,Need improve,"I have been using NG Magazine App on my Amazon Fire HD for over a year. It has problems here and there but usable. My biggest problem is the App crushes every time I got to the picture pages. Basically, I can read text just fine, but can't view any photos. What is left for NG Magazine without Photos? Now, the March 2015 issue has never showed up on the list for download, and March is almost over. I wonder if they are cooking a new app. Besides, there is no way to give a feedback for the App. That's why I had to resource to Amazon review. Hope the NGM App designers are reading those, and improve."
173,Geographic is unscientific in its criticism of GMO critics.,"National Geographic really fell down when it characterized critics of GMOs as anti-science on the front page of its last issue.  Then it presents NO evidence whatsoever in its article supporting the ""claim"" that GMOs are being called ""evil"", by those of us who challenge the lack of scientific review of the food safety of GMOs.  What passes for review is a company telling the FDA that their product is safe.  That is not good enough. The companies should be required to do a full food additive petition with the FDA on their new genetic constructs that we have not eaten before. It is not evil to ask for better review of the science of these products.  I am a geographer by training, but the National Geographic makes me ashamed when it does this kind of grandstanding. It should know better."
174,Too bad!,I cancelled my subscription because the format is too difficult.
175,Three Stars,"Pictures are great, it just took me some time to figure out how to move around the website."
176,Not that interesting.,"I was disappointed with this magazine. I used to read it a lot, but I didn't find much that interested me in this issue. I'm not interested in spending money to find out if it would get better."
177,Deserves ZERO Stars! Won't Download!,Why should I subscribe to something that I can't read? I haven't gotten one issue to download since last June or July. None of my other magazine subscriptions have the same problem. I will NOT be renewing this one.
178,Disappointed,Disappointed that nearly half the order came at once.  First mailing received three (3) issues.  One current and two back issues.
179,App is crap,Had to fight with the Kindle to get January. They improved the app and now I can't read February at all on my Kindle Fire HDX. The Kindle app for my Samsung phone can read it just fine.
180,The old app was a lot better than this,The old app was a lot better than this. The new app has been installed on my Fire for awhile now and will not download the January 2015 issue completely. I even tried deleting it and reinstalling it. I hope this is soon resolved.
181,WTF?,What does the title say 'kindle edition' and then when you try to subscribe it says that it is for fire phone only?
182,NG,National Geo.
183,Wasn't too happy about that,I had signed up for your rate and they charged me $49.  I had to call to get it straight.  Wasn't too happy about that.  But I do like the magazine.  but not the billing problem.
184,Three Stars,National Geographic is very brief and short not like it used to be.<br/>Wouldn't recommend it.
185,Three Stars,See review re Teen Vogue above.  Same problem.
186,Sad,"I bought the subscription with 1 month free offer, downloaded the free app, but it would never work.  It's been my experience that if you need an app to read a magazine on your fire, it's not going to work.  Talked to 3 Mayday techs - they could not help.  I deleted the app and canceled the subscription.  It's sad that Amazon offers it, but cannot support it.<br/><br/>I imagine if whatever needs to happen to have NatGeo directly on the fire would happen, it would look absolutely amazing."
187,Three Stars,"Love natgeo but subscription takes a couple months to start, not right away"
188,One Star,I much prefer the beautiful photographs of the paper version!!!!!
189,If you have enough time,"They must see me coming. If you can yawn your way through an entire article,  you are better than me. Too dry reading material. Pictures are breathtaking though"
190,Nice pictures,It's OK
191,Not upset with magazine content but-,I was confused to receive my first issue with three back ordered ones? Pretty bummed because we had already purchased them during our travels.
192,One Star,"Ordered Reader's Digest at the same time. Two issues of the Digest, still no Nat Geo"
193,"Cool mag, if it even gets here","Wonderful price (i caught the mother's day sale) for a great magazine. I just wish it would finally arrive! I think the amazon page warned that shipping takes a while, so take that seriously- it will take several months. I really hope it gets here soon, especially since I paid for 12 months and its already been two :("
194,Never received Subscription,"I subscibed to this magazine for over 6 motnhs now, however this magazine never reached, even though the statas says ""Shipped"" i was very disappointed."
195,Very disappointed.,"I am a 2nd grade teacher and thought that I was ordering the childrens' version.  Totally unhappy that I am paying on a subscription that I already had. My poor students, didn't get what we were hoping for."
196,Can not rate it! Never received it!,"I would love to be able to rate this subscription, but I have yet to receive my first issue.<br/>Can you tell me when I can expect it?<br/><br/>Thank you"
197,I am not continuing my subsctibtion,"I loved National Geographic. But you need to know, it's not for sensitive people like myself :) The images can get too natural ( like dead bodies of animals or even people). First several pages are delightful and very informative, but then you get shocked of the image on the next page. If you're curious about everything, including pretty nasty stuff, it's your magazine."
198,Mixed feeligs,I have off and on read NG for more than two decades.<br/>Pro:<br/>Pictures and stories of places I'll never see.<br/><br/>Con:<br/>preaching questionable environmental science gets really old and ruins the reputation of the material
199,SENT TO THE WRONG ADDRESS,"NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC IS A GREAT MAGAZINE.  BUT, I WANTED TO SEND THIS TO MY NEPHEW,<br/><br/>CHRISTOPHER HURLEY<br/>410 NORTH AVENUE<br/>NORTH FARM<br/>BRISTOL, R.I. 02809<br/><br/>IT WAS TO BE A CHRISTMAS PRESENT AND HE REALLY MISSES IT.  PLEASE MAKE THE ADDRESS CHANGE ASAP.<br/><br/>MANY THANKS,<br/><br/>RICHARD J. HURLEY"
200,"National Geographic has really ""slipped""!","I signed up and kept a subscription for two years.  I was amazed how often they supported and brought to surface the THEORY of Evolution.  Evolution is NOT a given Fact !<br/><br/>If you choose to believe it - be my guest.<br/><br/>But to promote it in nearly every article is too much!  Way too much.  Then, to have the audacity to belittle those that do not accept WHOLESALE  the Theory of Evolution.<br/><br/>There is some office that sticks a paragraph or two in every article promoting evolution.  For what reason  ???  I gave it up!"
201,Go to the magazine's website instead.,"I love Amazon, and they refunded it- but if you subscribe through this you may NEVER see your first issue so just go through National Geographic's website I think it's the same deal anyways."
202,NOT GETTING BETTER,"Over the last 50 years I've  been reading National Geographic, this magazine has been going downhill.  In the past you could count on having in depth writing about countries arround the world, which would justify giving National Geographic five stars.  Don't forget to post your rating and review."
203,Didn't get it yet.,Didn't get it.  Please check into this. I'm glad I was not counting on it for a gift.<br/><br/>Thanks.<br/><br/>Diane Fischer
204,Bad customer service,I subscribed for a friend in prison and he never got one copy and I complained and never got a response or a credit for anything.
205,Bought as a gift.,I purchased this as a gift for my Dad last year. The magazine must be great since he asked me to keep the subscription going. My only gripe is that they can not seem to get the mailing address right no matter how many times he has asked for it to be corrected. He receives his magazine a month or two late due to this.
206,Never Received ANYTHING,"I bought this subscription as a father's day gift for my dad who is out of state. He never received any National Geographic magazines after we were promised that they have been resent multiple times. I checked the address repeatedly to make sure there were no typos or incorrect information. They keep telling me that they are re-sending the magazines, but they will not give me my money back. We have contacted the postal service to make sure it wasn't a delivery issue by the mail man, and it wasn't. They had received any of my orders."
207,Subscription not extended as expected.,Just received the December edition. The label does not reflect an extension of my subscription to 2014 as expected. If the magazine stops coming I will as Amazon for a credit for the full amount of the subscription. If it does I will withdraw this rating and re-evaluate.
208,National geographic subscription,"I hope this is the lowest rating, because I did't want it for my self I thought I was renewing my son's subscription.  Is there any way I can transfer it to my son's ?  Henry Fanoe.  Let me know."
209,Just not for me.,"This is a fine magazine. Just not my cup of tea. I prefer motorcycling, pop science and handyman mags. Good day."
210,Took a few months for the first issue,I was getting ready to cancel when I finally received my first issue...three months later. I had read other reviews and was beginning to have my doubts. Of course it's an excellent magazine but I didn't know the first issue was going to take so long.
211,Not much in it...,I read the first one in 15 minutes.<br/>Not much of intrest in it for me.<br/>It has turned into a left wing rag.
212,Great magazine... when you get it,It's the ONLY magazine subscription I'll ever be faithful to. The quality has been the same ever since I picked up my first National Geographic. The reason I give one star is mostly because I only received a few magazines during a whole year of subscription.
213,Not top reading,Not as good as the older issues which may be that we have already been informed.  Still good but not top of my list.
214,Their bias is showing....,"The  National Geographic of old is just that. Old and sorely missed. They've plunged neck deep in advocating green initiative agendas before the science has been decided.<br/>Need proof? Check into their ""ice age"" issues of the early 70's. Yeah the articles promising we'd all be frozen by now."
215,Not happy with it,I Havent receive tha magazine and i subscribe to it in november. We are in march. Not satisfied at all.
216,Never Received,I have never received my order.  It's been so long since I ordered the magazine I forgot about it.  Thanks for reminding me.  Would love to start getting my subscription!
217,National Geographic,This was ordered for my granddaughter out of town also.  She has not yet received it since the first issue is not scheduled to arrive until early Feb.  I am sure she will enjoy it since she is familiar with magazine and love articles from all over the wold.  She also loves animals so this should be very good for her.
218,Magazine Great - Fulfillment not so much,Ordered magazine -- didn't come for several weeks.  Then 3 months came on the same day.  Kind of defeats the monthly nature of the periodical.
219,Why would I want 3 issues all at the same time?,"I absolutely hate when a magazine chooses to send me multiple issues at the same time to start my subscription.  I don't have time to get through 3 issues before the next one comes.  I'm sure it's much more convenient for the publisher but in this day and age, their computers can easily keep track of when my subscription starts and ends.  At this point, I am unlikely to renew this subscription because of this practice."
220,"Great magazine, stinky policies","I enjoy the magazine. However, theyt started out by dumping old issues to use up my subscription. I received three isues in one day. Yuk :-("
221,Received the first 3 issues at the same time,Received the first 3 issues in the mail at the same time. Will be interesting to see how the next issue come.
222,Still waiting (in the 21st century),"First issue due to arrive in 6, yes SIX weeks..I HOPE!<br/>A little ridiculous in the 21st century. See Newsweek's fate!"
223,"Love the mag, but not happy to get two issues that I've already read.","I love National Grographic. Great pictures, good stories. That isn't the cause of my two star review. The problem is the subscription service. For some reason, they sent me three issues all at one time: the current issue and two back issues!  I already paid for the past two issues in the store, why are they sending the OLD magazines?  I dont want 1/6th of my subscription to be something I already own."
224,"Too many ""bells and whistles""","I downloaded the current trial magazine (which was &gt;250 MB), hoping to start a subscription on my new Kindle Fire HD. Unfortunately, the subscription is so thick with features that it is hard to navigate smoothly.  It is slow and cumbersome to respond; example: taking two swipes to turn a page or playing video and the sound is all that comes through.  Pictures are beautiful but I don't want this frustration while trying to enjoy the magazine."
225,Disappointed Because...,"I just rec'd the October issue, with one week left in the month. I would like the subscription to start with the November issue, not the the October at this late date. I have issues w/ the magazine itself."
226,What magazine,Hard to rate this subscription cause I Have not received anything yet.  No magazine or even a account number so I can view it on my tablet.
227,Mainly Propaganda,"I cancelled my subscription after 30years because I was tired of most of the articles pushing propaganda.  NG was long held as a neutral source of accurate info, but no longer true."
228,Avoid,"I bought the one year subscription (December 2011) but already receiving ""notices"" that my subscription is about to run out and that I need to renew (now only 6 months later). I don't get the magazines on time and one month never even got it!"
229,Still not here,Ordered over 8 weeks ago and magazine subscription is not here yet.......Dont do it if your not willing to wait.....Very Slow
230,Have not received magazine,"I still have not received the magazine.  I ordered it back in early September,and was hoping to have gotten an issues by now."
231,Worst Customer Services,They charge my credit card and waited for 7 week never received it. But when ask for a credit they only gave me 1/2 of my subscription..<br/>For me was a total failure and that a shame because I think the magazine is amassing.<br/>Never heard from a representative from customer service.
232,Beware!,"I tried to leave no stars, but I wasn't allowed.  Don't do it...you'll never get it.  Shame on Amazon for not removing this subscription as an option."
233,Somewhat disappointed,"I hadn't taken this magazine for years, not since I read reliable reports about the old management and their CIA connections.  A while ago I got in my snailmain mailbox ""an offer I couldn't refuse"" for a year's subscription. I bit.<br/><br/>It's OK. The photos are still good, but the magazine kills a whole lot of trees.  It comes loaded with loose ads that fall out as I turn pages, and are not interesting.  The attitude is still rather imperialistic, so I won't be subscribing again."
234,Warning: They will send you back issues you may not want,"Okay, the magazine itself is great.  But be warned: when you order it, you will receive several back issues that you may very well already have purchased.  I ordered it and received the new March issue plus the old January and February issues that I already have.  I'll try to call them tomorrow to fix it, but what a pain.  I would guess it is because they have lots of old unsold issues lying around anyway.<br/><br/>National Geographic has a great magazine and some good documentaries, but their business side is awful.  Such a stupid move to send me old issues.  It just makes me really dislike the whole thing."
235,Can't believe it takes such a long time,"I subscribed it from Amazon in August 13, 2010, but I haven't received any single one so far, and today is already Jan 7, 2011. Does it take such a long time???"
236,National Geographic,"NG Mag usually holds my attention with mostly interesting articles.  Some issues dwell too much on a single subject (that may be near and dear to us, like water).<br/>There used to be more short articles (Geographica).<br/>The magazine used to have more varied as well as more in-depth articles and pictures.<br/>Many articles have environmently ""slanted"" articles, instead of objective articles."
237,Nor what it used to be,"In my humble opinion National Geographic is just<br/>a  shadow of the once great magazine it once was.<br/>I had the unfortunate experience of dealing with<br/>The NG staff trying to turn off the repetitive and<br/>Persistent renewal notices and encountered a<br/>Bunch of bureaucratic morons.  It is a shame<br/>There is no longer integrity in the  management<br/>of the the magazine.  Remember,  you asked ."
238,DON'T BUY!!,"I bought the subscription in June 2010 and haven't received any magazines so far. I sent couple of email asking for status and got no response. I am very disappointed about this purchase. Save your money, look else for National Geographic subscription."
239,Have not received the magazine yet.,"Its been a month, and I do not think magazine subscriptions get started in that time.  Need to wait for a few more weeks to evaluate."
240,One-year subscription but got only one issue,"Received only one issue for a one-year subscription, and nothing in the following three months.<br/>I contacted the customer service and was told that my subscription was canceled due to a system error.  The refund will appear in one to two billing statements of my credit card (I hope).<br/>What if I didn't catch that error? Are they going to just take the money and do nothing? This is disgusting and dishonest.  Never subscribe any magazine from them again.<br/><br/>Update: never received that refund."
241,Prepare to wait a lifetime for your first issue,"I ordered this subscription to National Geographic in late August. Afterwards, I'm told I wont even get my first issue until late November. So prepare to wait a lifetime if you subscribe here. You may or may not have better luck through the publisher's direct website."
242,"Great Magazine, Poor Amazon Service","National Geographic is a great magazine, but after purchasing it through Amazon because of a discount they gave me, they inexplicably canceled the transaction claiming something went wrong.  They asked me to reorder, but I'm not sure I want to go through the hassle."
243,The vendor refused to honor the $15 subscripton request.,The vendor refused to honor the $15 subscripton request.<br/><br/>I tried previosly when it was $10 with the same result.<br/><br/>Good Luck to you.
244,Another cancelled order...,"As others have stated, probably not a great idea to order Nat Geo through Amazon.  I placed my order in June and received a cancellation e-mail from them today.  If Amazon can't fill the subscriptions at this price, they shouldn't be offering it.  Great magazine, just don't order it here."
245,Wouldn't know,"I ordered this loong time ago, still have not received it. But when I had it years ago, it was a very interesting read."
246,National Geographic Magazine,"National Geographic Magazine was purchased through Amazon.  I called National Georgraphic to check if this publication would be received in a timely manner as it was a gift for my son.  I was told that because it was purchased through an ""outside source"" that it would take longer - possible 8 weeks or more.  How disappointing for me!  I am not happy.  Thank"
247,Slipping quality,"Was once a stellar magazine and ""family"" style business (late 1800's to 2000). Since then the quality has declined along with the content in the magazine.<br/><br/>Revised  4/2011<br/><br/>Now even worse with a left wing political agenda.  Discovery is a much better choice!"
248,Stunning Photography,"The best thing about National Geographic is the photography. I like this magazine because it allows you to travel the world from the comfort of your favorite chair.The articles are a little boring sometimes.(The reviewer was compensated for posting this review.  However, the opinion stated in the review is that of the reviewer and the reviewer alone. Further, the reviewer independently selected this product to review and has no affiliation with the product maker/distributor, Amazon or the review requester.)"
249,No news!,"I made a gift subscription for this magazine, National Geographic in December 2009. And am still wondering if the first copy has been delivered to the address.<br/>I can give a proper review only when i get a confirmation that the magazine has already been posted to the address!!!!"
250,Where is my Subscription?,I subscribed in December 2009.  It is now February 2010 and still no sign of this magazine.
251,How long do you wait?,I purchased this National Geographic subscription for my husband in December and it is now February and I still have not received ONE issue?  I would hesitate recommending 'signing up' for that reason.
252,Quality information,"I refer to National Georgraphic Mag Jan issue where they featured Singapore. I enjoyed reading the article about my country as I was from Singapore and felt that the writer has captured the essence of Singapore very well.<br/>However, I was disappointed with the photos portraying Singapore. The Pictures do not represent the modern, hi-tech and ""man-made"" beauty of the gardens and the structures of the island as it should. Instead, it has pictures that were just showing Asian faces or of landscape that made Singapore feel like it was back in the 60s.This warped visual view of Singapore does not potray the Singapore of today."
253,Very slow in recieving,I ordered the subscription on 11/24/09 Hope it only takes 4-6 weeks. Have two more weeks to go. Could have ordered it direct from NG and started it right away but was $10.00 more. It may turn out to be a better buy if I don't receive it...
254,"Used to be great, now it is mere political","I picked up a copy recently and found the same mind-numbing drivel (regarding salmon in the Northwest) that can be found at any uber-leftist commune.  All slant, even the facts.<br/><br/>If the magazine is that far off base on something that I know quite a lot about, how can I trust anything else that it prints from parts of the world that I don't know?...I can't."
255,Faked picture,"One photo on 12, 2009. In the article another tibet, a picture of local disco is obviously faked. Look at the face , just some stupid actors. It is not real. There is no equipment in that disco. The door is not the disco should have. These doors must be anti-fire, then they can get the permit to run business. As a person have 20 years experience living there, this faked photo is unacceptable. You should be ashamed."
256,Great Magazine......Dont Get It From Amazon,"National Geographic is a wonderful magazine that any one can enjoy. However, do not subscribe to it from amazon. Why pay thirty some dollars, when you can get the exact same thing from the National Geographic Website for fifteen dollars. I do recomend that you get this magazine, you will not regret it. Just save your money and don't get it from Amazon.com."
257,"Great photos, Liberal agenda driven contents","I have been a subscriber to National Geographic since mid 1990s when I was back in Iran. I remember receiving this good magazine with pictures being marked or censored by postal authorities in Islamic Iran yet I loved it. However, this magazine has really lost its once proud tradition of presenting fair and true scientific contents and has replaced it with some liberal agenda driven stuff like promoting nonsense like global warming, world peace and getting anti-U.S rhetoric/politics involved when writing about other nations like their past issue that was dedicated to Iran. All in all, this magazine  is good in terms of first rate photographies. 3/5"
258,Having a Problem Changing Billing Address,I ordered this magazine for my son on 6/22/08.  He has yet to receive his first issue and now has a new address.  I'm having a terrible time trying to correct the shipping address.
259,"Unable to review, has not been recieved yet, was ordered on June 30th, 08","This magazine was ordered on June 30th, my Son has not recieved it yet???????? So can not comment on a review at this time."
260,Junk Mail galore,"I will no longer subscribe to National Geographic.  This year we started getting unsolicited junk from either National Geographic or their ""partner"" companies masquerading as National Geographic and then billing us for the DVDs, maps, etc.  I expressed my concerns in a letter to National Geographic about the problem and they did not bother to contact me.  Of course now they are sending these bogus bills to their ""collection department.""  No more National Geographic magazine EVER!"
261,Do not buy through Amazon but directly,"I bought National Geographics for my elderly father over 3 months ago. To this day no magazines have arrived. Tired of waiting and after a phone call from him, I barred the wait to talked to someone in NG. They told me that going through Amazon takes at least 3 months!!! and that they have shiped my order two day ago and it will take 2 weeks in transport. If I go directly through them it takes 1 months."
262,Complain about the efficiency,Actually I have not received this magazine yet. Could you please help me to check it? Thanks.
263,"Good, but spendy","Apparently everyone writing reviews is made of money...well if that is the case, let me tell you a little secret: if you go garage sailing you can often find an entire year of NG for like $20.  And sometimes it is even a recent year.  I say save the trash heaps and the trees, and the green (if you catch my drift) and shop around before you go buying new stuff.  It has cool covers, and you can collect them regardless of their condition."
264,Changing History,"You think a magazine such as National Geographic would be about facts and true reporting of those facts of the world we are living in  today. But , no, the Arab states money has clouded their facts slightly and made them into something of a fiction. They tried to change the Persian Gulf to Arabian Gulf, thinking no one would notice???? Well, Persia was there thousands of years a go and its one of the oldest civilisations of  the world. New Arabian money can not and will not change that history and will not rename the Persian Gulf. Changing history usually happens when parts of history have been forgotten. Well iran and Iranians live and their history has not and will never be forgotten. As long as one Iranian lives , Persian gulf will remain Persian."
265,Great Magazine,"I've read National Geographic since I was a little. I always enjoyed the wonderful photography in the magazine, and I have to admit, that's still the part of the magazine that I enjoy the most. Oh, I read the articles once in a while, but many of them have a liberal slant on them that I don't appreciate. Still despite that, the stories are usally well written and the pictures remain outstanding."
266,"A fallen star, very disappointing","I have a collection that goes back to 1965, and I have been a subscriber for some 20 years.<br/>The magazine; however, has become the province of the radical environmetalist movement. The editorial content leans heavily toward the left, and the choice and variety of articles has degenerated over the years. Even the quality of the writing has been eroded as the magazine tries to reach a wider audience with its leftist environmental propaganda.<br/>In sum, a great publication has been hijacked by a group of irrational environmentalists who have little interest in any subject other than trees and the occasional politically correct topic."
